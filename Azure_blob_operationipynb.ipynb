              "  'C': \"Dr. MaryAnne Rizk, Medableâ€™s Chief Strategy Officer, discusses why sponsors are embracing the decentralized model more often and how it's solving issues like accessibility and diversity.\",\n",
              "  'D': 'Clinical research is radically changing as more and more trial sponsors embrace a decentralized model to solve two fundamental challenges: addressing barriers to clinical trial accessibility and improving diversity amongst clinical trial participants.At least half of FDA trials in the US are conducted in only 1-2% of zip codes.Â\\xa0Low participation in clinical trials remains an issue across research, with less than 5% of the global population participating. In addition, 85% of clinical trials fail to meet their enrollment targets, which is more than three times the number of those that are successful. Of the trials that achieve their enrollment targets, a lack of diversity due to accessibility remains a big issue.Â\\xa0If the current clinical research process doesnâ€™t adapt to these changing population demographics, the life sciences industry will continue developing drugs and devices that are only shown to work for a select few, leaving out the rest.The access to novel clinical trial digital tools creates opportunities for patient diversity in research. As a result, we see a shift from site-centered to patient-centered research, as the industry is proactively engaging with patients in a way that better fits their needs, according to Dr. MaryAnne Rizk, Medableâ€™s Chief Strategy Officer. The goal, says Rizk, is to ensure that we are actively capturing the voice of patients so we create better treatments for everybody. In this interview, Rizk discusses how this shift will manifest in real life.Moe Alsumidaie:Â\\xa0Should all drug development be patient-centric? What are the biggest challenges in clinical research today hindering patient-centricity?MaryAnne Rizk: I believe decentralized research is the path to all-inclusive medicine for the broader patient population. We get there by creating a more convenient journey for patients that empowers the flexibility of choice for clinical care as an option that is either remote or a hybrid. Medableâ€™s CEO is a practicing physician and brings a fresh perspective with her medical lens to how we reshape patient engagement, affording us a rare opportunity to put technologies in the hands of patients so we can learn what works best for their needs and drive the best results for more all-inclusive treatments.However, one challenge standing in the way is learning how to evolve the site of the future. We believe sites are fundamental to patient experiences, so we want to enhance their essential role through technology, not replace sites with technology. The future is a hybrid. Some patients will want to engage remotely as much as possible, and others may prefer to do some visits at a local site and some remotely and just one or two at the primary site. In other words, tomorrowâ€™s research site may not look the same as it does today. For instance, it might be a retail pharmacy or community clinic with a central site coordinating care and leveraging advanced technology. Medable is helping to reduce the patient and clinician burden and capture better data by digitizing as much of the research process as sensible.Data capture is another challengeâ€”and a significant opportunity to capture critical insights from study visits. Thanks to the decentralization of trials, we have a proliferation of data collected earlier and more often from various sources. There are inherent challenges with the sheer quantity and variety of data today. But Medable is driving a radical movement to be closer to patients, modernize sites, and establish a concierge-like serviceâ€”a consumer-grade experience for patients that makes data insights easier to capture. When we collect patient data before, during, and after a study, we can partner with sponsors on the meaningful use of that data.MA: How do you aim to increase DCT adoption in the clinical trials industry?MR: Medable has engaged over one million patients across a myriad of over 5,000 sites globally, operating in 40 countries across 60 languagesâ€”itâ€™s a significant start. With the broad expansion of reaching more patients and sites globally, we are advancing the capabilities to make an impact. A flexibly decentralized model needs to enable greater patient access while providing a flexible and seamless experience across all users that improves trial operations and time to treatment.Â\\xa0For example, Medable empowered one precision medicine company to develop new therapies for a rare disease screening of age-related macular degeneration that required a deeper understanding of the disease and cost-effectively screening of 11,000 patients. Our decentralized platform model and direct-to-patient shipment workflow drove a 50% reduction in patient enrollment time and a 75% reduction in study sites, resulting in a $20M decrease in trial costs to achieve the studyâ€™s endpoints.Moving forward, the way to continue to expand the DCT adoption is to design technology solutions that are agile, simple, and elegantâ€”employing human-centered design. A good design is visible, but an exceptional design is invisible. As an example, weâ€™re now seeing improved intelligence to optimize the enrollment period and study startup. Weâ€™re getting feedback, not just after a trial but throughout the cycles of a clinical setup. This is important as weâ€™re looking to optimize how we approach our sites, creating programs like our Site Network Council that give us valuable insights to optimize the way they work and create the highest value. To do this, we are creating executive leadership teams at Medable that bring together a rich pedigree of scientific, medical, technology, and design backgrounds to advance how research is conducted from a remote setting.Second, engaging directly with patients is crucial, and Medable is doing this by nurturing collaborative networks with patient advocacy groups and physicians. Consider the consenting process. Medableâ€™s consent tool ensures patients understand what theyâ€™re going to be signing up for, which is critical because the most informed patient is the most engaged patient. As a result, we see up to 90% patient satisfaction.Lastly, it is critical to up-skill the talent needed for the next generation of the resources necessary to modernize clinical trials. What will a digital CRA or a digital analyst, or an architect look like in a few years? What are some of the things they need to think about when using data, digital technologies, and accommodating patient engagement? The industry should be motivated to champion leaders who will help advance the mission because no one can do it alone. We want to create an ecosystem of partners, sites, patients, sponsors, and CROs motivated to expedite faster treatments.MA: Will DCTs bridge the racial and economic divides in clinical research? Can you tell me why or why not?MR: DCTs are changing the future of research. And the two leading critical success factors in terms of the impact of radically advancing clinical research are access and diversity. The convenience of accessing clinical trials within your iOS devices or mobile devices opens us to a world of ubiquitous accessâ€”and this is naturally enabling more diverse data sets so that FDA-approved medicines will be as effective to ensure a diverse representation of people from varied economic and racial backgrounds; expanding clinical trial access to many more patients.Also, today we see a new trend in patient-centered intelligent protocol design, boosted by a digitally focused mindset. The focus on diversity drives industry-wide change that includes widening the net with more access to care.MA: Why are you passionate about human-centered research?MR: Human-centered research is about putting the patients first and creating a consumer-grade experience for trial participants. Today we put the letter â€œEâ€\\x9d in front of everything, right? E-consent, E-visit, etc. And because weâ€™re moving through this digital age, you recognize that the patterns needed to improve and impact require understanding and predictive analytics.If weâ€™re able to advance the way we bring data and insights together, not only for clinical research but also, so patients have access to better careâ€”that is why Iâ€™m wildly passionate about human-centered design. We recognize that the impact and the outcome are rich in terms of the unique advantage of improving health care through technologies and data tools.MA:Â\\xa0Youâ€™ve worked on E-clinical systems at a range of established enterprises like Merck, IQVIA, and Oracle. So, what inspired you to join a growing company like Medable?MR: Medable is on a mission to modernize clinical research for the benefit of patients. During the pandemic, I was given this opportunity to go where I could make the largest impact. And when I learned Medableâ€™s vision is to redesign the way clinical trials should be conducted to focus on patients, it was in perfect alignment with my view. Medable wants to create the most intuitive patient experience and build on a true, cloud-based SaaS-enabled technology platform, matching my mission. This is the way to create the most significant impact, with ubiquitous access to care through the modernization of clinical trials. And when we think about what it takes to create this impact, it involves understanding the patient, generating a user community thatâ€™s going to provide input on their expectations to create predictive insights on whatâ€™s needed for clinical trials.Additionally, Medable has put together a world-class team of leaders with rich domain expertise, whether youâ€™re in operations, product management, technology, operations, clinical development, patient engagement, science, or compliance. Itâ€™s exciting for me to get the chance to work with such brilliant minds for collective drive impact forward.My role is to find a unique way to develop novel innovation partnerships for a diversified ecosystem. Iâ€™m fully committed so that we can intelligently connect patients and sites to advance medical research.Moe Alsumidaie, MBA, MSF, is a thought leader and expert in the application of business analytics toward clinical trials, and Editorial Advisory Board member for and regular contributor to Applied Clinical Trials.'},\n",

              "  'D': \"There is increased interest in the provision of healthcare in a manner that is more convenient to the patient. The COVID-19 pandemic has further shifted this trend, driven by the need for social distancing precautions to avoid unnecessary personal contact and potential exposure to the virus. Virtual doctorsâ€™ visits and remote COVID-19 testing have now become commonplace.1 This shift towards patient-centricity in healthcare has accelerated telemedicine and at-home testing, bypassing the inconvenience of travel and time away from family, work, and school.1,2 These approaches use technology to build systems around the patient. We are in a unique moment, with an opportunity to rethink how healthcare is provided, to improve health outcomes by increasing accessibility and decreasing patient burden. Can we build upon what we have learned during the pandemic and develop patient-centric approaches across healthcare?3An important component for the provision of patient-centric healthcare is the ability to collect blood samples remotely in a manner that delivers samples of a quality comparable to that of current standard phlebotomy collection, enabling routine clinical testing, monitoring disease progression and testing drug concentrations.2,4,5 This blood sampling could be performed at the patientâ€™s home, at a nearby pharmacy, or at a local clinic, rather than a centralized facility. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that home-based phlebotomy will become increasingly common and is preferred by many patients over more traditional approaches involving centralized clinical facilities.5-7 The ability to collect a sample of blood without needing a phlebotomist can decrease patient burden and improve patient compliance, especially with scheduled sample collections.Significant technological advancements in analytical science have enabled the use of very small blood sample volumes for quantitative testing. However, standard venipuncture approaches are still being practiced to collect several milliliters of venous blood, of which less than 10% is typically used for testing. These advancements are making the current logistical and procedural hurdles for patients more a function of habit and inertia, rather than medical necessity. Reducing the volume of blood collected is critical, particularly amongst vulnerable populations like oncology and pediatric patients.8,9 The possibility of reducing blood collection volumes in adults was proposed by Smoller in 1989, by employing pediatric-sized tubes.10 Since then, technological advancements have made the collection of reduced blood volumes a reality. Coupling convenient, routine blood sampling approaches with advanced highly sensitive analytical testing can provide high quality decisional data in a patient-centric manner.The collection of a small volume of blood from a heel prick has been used for over 60 years for metabolic and genetic testing in newborns. More recently, this technology has advanced significantly, with commercially available devices that collect high quality blood samples from finger pricks or the upper arm for all age groups.11 Importantly, these sampling devices do not require a phlebotomist to be present. Instead, the sample can be self-collected, or with the assistance of a care giver and are designed to collect small volumes of blood of the same quality as professionally collected venous blood.12Â\\xa0Some of these techniques require a finger-prick using a lancet, followed by blood collection, while others are self-contained devices with a built-in incision and blood collection.Â\\xa0Examples of commercially available devices include the Neoteryx Mitra,13 Tasso-M20, SST and Tasso+,14 SeventhSense TAP and TAP II,15 Trajan hemaPEN,16 Labcorp Pixel,17 Capitainer qDBS,18 HemaXis DB10 and DX,19 Drawbridge OneDraw.20 These devices are capable of collecting from as little as 20 microliters (approximately half a drop) to several hundred microliters of blood and have been widely used to determine clinical parameters,21 drug concentrations,5,22 therapeutic drug monitoring,23 and more recently, COVID antibody levels.24,25 Some of these devices enable the collection of a fixed volume of blood, collected as dried blood, which can then be shipped and handled at room temperaturesâ€”avoiding the need for freezers and dry-ice for storing and shipping samplesâ€”enabling its adoption even in remote areas with limited infrastructure.Â\\xa0Devices are also available for the collection of a small volume of wet blood from the upper arm which can then be separated as plasma or serum, similar to a standard venipuncture blood draw, thus providing the same liquid matrix for analysis (examples include Tasso SST and SeventhSense TAP II).Patient-centric blood sampling techniques have been gaining popularity for use in pharmaceutical drug development; however, to date they have not been broadly accessible to the general public.26 This can be partially attributed to the â€œclinic-centricâ€\\x9d healthcare model, where reimbursement is dependent on in-person visits and sample collection. Thus, the status quo remains and anyone who needs a blood test is required to go to the doctorâ€™s office or clinic. However, recent experiences have demonstrated that these techniques can be widely implemented and that commercially available blood sampling devices are a perfect complement to the exponentially expanding space of telemedicine.25 It is apparent that improving patient convenience and the sampling experience, as well as enabling more frequent testing, can improve and expand monitoring of our â€œbodiesâ€\\x9d to know if everything is okay or react to issues early. Such information can empower the physician and patient to seek earlier intervention and evolve beyond reactive treatment, toward proactive disease prevention.The cost of some of the technologies involved in this new paradigm may be higher than traditional blood collection approaches. However, studies have demonstrated that the overall cost to society will be lower, by improving health outcomes and allowing broader access and patient convenience.27 The availability and adoption of patient-centric approaches can provide access and treatment options to patients not geographically co-located with clinical sites and improving access in rural or lesser developed communities, globally, potentially improving general health of the population.The responsibility for our collective health belongs to us all. The successful adoption and implementation of these blood sampling capabilities will require stakeholders to work together across organizational boundaries to deliver improved care. The benefits of implementing home blood sampling are clear; however, there are challenges for widespread adoption including training to ensure proper collection and processes for expedited return of the sample for analysis.Â\\xa0Advances in mobile technologies for training, data capture (time/date stamp) and sample tracking, along with expanding home delivery and collection processes are expected to potentially alleviate this. We believe the learnings from the COVID pandemic will further drive innovation, including the ability to conveniently sample blood at home. This is a call for action for healthcare systems to make â€œpatient-centricâ€\\x9d blood sampling a reality to improve human health.Enaksha WickremsinheÂ\\xa0is a Researh Advisor for Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company.

              "  'D': 'If the debate has been heated over vaccines for adults and on the need for extra booster shots, FDA and its expert advisors will face even more scrutiny over the safety and value of vaccinating children under age 12. This population generally has had much lower COVID-19 infection rates than adults, but hospitalizations now have increased dramatically with the spread of the Delta variant, plus the return to school and other activities. The rise in pediatric COVID cases has alarmed the medical community, yet widespread vaccine hesitancy among many parents will make it critical to present strong safety results to gain broad protection for children.The issue has moved to center stage as Pfizer/BioNTech announced plans to seek FDA approval this month of a smaller dose of its Comirnaty vaccine for children ages five-11, as well as similar approval from the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities. As Pfizer did in expanding use of its vaccine to younger adolescents, the company will file an emergency use application (EUA) with FDA, based on results from a Phase II/III study of a two-dose regimen on over 4000 participants aged six months to 11 years.1 The study shows, according to Pfizer, that a lower 10-microgram shot for the five-to-11 age group, one-third the dose for adults and adolescents, provides a sufficiently robust neutralizing antibody response, while also supporting safety and tolerability in these young subjects.The clinical trial also enrolled similar numbers of younger children ages 6 months to five years and hopes to provide topline readouts for this group by year-end. Children under age five received a lower three microgram dose for each of two injections, and results will be evaluated for two age cohorts, children two-five years of age and those six months to two years old.This initial Pfizer/BioNTech statement did not present specific study data, but sponsor said it will submit its research results for publication in a scientific peer-reviewed journal, while also preparing its filing for FDA. The announcement specified that clinical trials in multiple regions enrolled 2,268 children ages five-11, with one-third receiving placebo. However, due to the generally lower infection rate among youngsters, there were too few numbers of ill participants to determine higher protection from the vaccine vs. placebo; that conclusion is based on a comparison of higher immune response levels in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated study participants.The sponsor also notes that the lower dose for children can be linked to fewer side effects. In an early study that administered higher doses to young participants, adverse events were higher, although still comparable to older patients. But those children who received the lower dose experienced fewer incidences of fever, headache and fatigue, while also showing a strong antibody response. Even after increasing the size of the pediatric trial at FDAâ€™s request, Pfizer found no cases of heart inflammation or other serious side effects that have occurred after vaccination with some older individuals, although the sponsors continue to monitor study participants for ongoing effects.FDA staff will review the Pfizer data closely following its submission and is expected to ask its Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRPBAC) to weigh the results and make recommendations. If approved, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) then will propose a specific vaccination schedule.In response to earlier pressure from some quarters for FDA to quickly authorize preventives for younger children, agency leaders explained the need for very careful scientific evaluation to ensure that any vaccines for children are safe, as well as effective. FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock and Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), penned a statement in early September emphasizing that FDA â€œwill follow the scienceâ€\\x9d to fully assess the safety of current vaccines. Woodcock and Marks also warned parents not to pressure pediatricians to provide their children with a vaccine approved for adults and adolescents:as far as vaccines go, children are not just young adults.2Referenceshttps://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-topline-resulthttps://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/2f09162'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Amid political pressures and dissension on multiple fronts, FDA and its panel of vaccine experts weighed the evidence and worked to ensure a science-based decision on whether to authorize additional shots of Pfizerâ€™s COVID-19 preventive to further protect those already receiving recommended doses. The day-long meeting Sept. 17, 2021 of FDAâ€™s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)1 concluded with the panel recommending that a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine be authorized only for patients over age 65, plus those at high risk of infection related to occupation, such as health care workers and teachers.A formal recommendation from FDA on the Pfizer booster, likely to be issued today, will be considered this week by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (DCD). That panel will advise practitioners and health agencies on when and where to administer any additional shots in ongoing efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.The FDA advisors agreed unanimously on the more limited booster plan after soundly rejecting Pfizerâ€™s original request to authorize its third shot for everyone over age 16, as covered by the BLA for the vaccine recently approved recently by FDAâ€™s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The panel felt there was insufficient data to support more widespread administration, and that boosters could pose added risks for men under age 40, who have experienced rare cases of myocarditis following vaccination. A main point of discussion was whether waning immunity from the initial two-dose vaccine regimen was due to effects of the Delta variant or to limitations of the Pfizer vaccine itself. Pfizer researchers published a letter in Sept. 15 the New England Journal of Medicine summarizing its research to support a booster dose,2 but that failed to convince the advisory panel of the need for widespread third shots.The debate over the issue was intensified by the recent announcement of pending departures of leading FDA officials who had expressed dismay over earlier statements by President Biden backing booster shots in the U.S. while FDA was examining the issue. Marion Gruber, long time director of CBERâ€™s Office of Vaccine Research & Review (OVRR), and OVRR deputy director Phillip Krause announced last month that they would both retire from FDA after many years of service, most recently shepherding through speedy emergency approvals for effective anti-COVID vaccines.In addition, Gruber and Krause were prominent co-authors of a leading article published in The Lancet questioning booster shots while much of the world still awaited initial COVID vaccines.3 The article by a group of vaccine scientists formed by the World Health Organization (WHO) argues that much uncertainty remains about the timing and value of extra shots, and that boosters for healthy adults should be delayed until at least 40% of the global population is vaccinated.The debate within the Biden administration and FDA opened the door to widespread criticism and questioning of the booster shot policy. Leading House Republicans charged FDA officials with caving to White House pressure to speed access to booster shots and demanded that FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock provide them with all documents related to the study and implementation of a booster shot option plus communications between the agency and the White House on thisissue.4Pfizer, Israeli data donâ€™t convinceWhile the politicians look to make points over the policy debate, the VRBAC panel weighed the scientific evidence presented at the Sept. 17 session. That included current data on COVID-19 prevalence, infection and hospitalization rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and from the United Kingdom. Of particular interest was a report on how a recent Pfizer vaccine booster program in Israel reduced infection rates and hospitalizations. Pfizer presented its own analysis on how protection from Comirnaty waned over six months after initial doses and how boosters could provide important added protection. But the advisors found the Israeli and Pfizer data too limited and unconvincing to approve boosters for the entire U.S. population. The narrower recommendation to add shots for the elderly and immune-compromised is seen as a compromise to provide protection where most needed while sponsors gain added information.A main issue for the international health research community still is whether still limited supplies of effective preventives should be provided to those already protected by authorized shots, while vaccines remain severely limited in many in regions of the world. The advisory panel did not address that question directly, and ample vaccine supplies in the U.S. appeared to offset the issue.Members of the advisory panel and experts from CDC and FDA did agree that more widespread vaccination of the American public would do more to prevent high COVID infection rates than booster shots for those already benefiting from protection. However, that possibility was further countered by the ranting of vaccine opponents about the safety and value of any COVID preventive, as heard in multiple presentations during the usual one-hour public comment period at the VRBAC meeting.The debate will continue, as Moderna has announced it also will seek FDA approval of a third shot to its two-dose vaccine regimen, citing similar waning of antibodies six months after the second shot and no added safety concerns. Perhaps Moderna will consider closely the recent debate and target its booster plan to the higher-risk population, as recommended by the advisory panel for the Pfizer preventive.Referenceshttps://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-september-17-2021-meeting-announcement#event-informationhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113468?query=TOC&cid=NEJM+eToc%2C+September+16%2C+2021+DM295772_NEJM_Non_Subscriber&bid=617019028https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02046-8/fulltexthttps://www.republicanwhip.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Letter-to-FDA-on-Political-Interference.pdf'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Even before COVID stimulated renewed urgency in mechanisms to promote rapid and efficient product development, the drive for innovativeâ€“and more complexâ€“clinical trials was already well underway in Europe and beyond. The response to the pandemic has, however, given new momentum to many ongoing reflections on getting a betterâ€“ and fasterâ€“bang from the bucks (or more elegantly, more patient benefit from platform trials) in clinical development.Large-scale platformsWhile the classic RCT may remain the preferred approach for many regulators, there is growing concern over its costs and delays, and a reinforced appetite to overcome the associated challenges in subject recruitment, and in patients finding the right trial for their needs. One of the key tasks of HERA, the European Union\\'s newly-announced strategy for tackling health risks, is to work with the European Medicines Agency \"to create a long-term and large-scale EU platform for multi-center clinical trials and corresponding data platforms.\"Â\\xa0This \\'European Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority\\', unveiled in mid-September, will incentivize \"advanced research, innovation and development of relevant technologies and countermeasuresâ€“including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines,\" says the official announcement, and will promote data sharing arrangements that \"can lead to breakthrough discoveries and accelerate the development of health solutions.\" It will, it says, rely heavily on European clinical trial networks and platforms \"to accelerate trials and connect all development stakeholders for designing and conducting trials.\" These platforms should, it adds, be easily adjustable to respond to a broad range of potential threats, and should reduce current lead times.Fragmented EuropeEU officials acknowledge that the trial landscape in response to the pandemic has been fragmented, with a multitude of small, national trials, struggling to generate robust and actionable clinical data, with great duplication of efforts and direct competition for shared resources and participant populations. Action has already been taken to build a COVID therapeutics network, based on three large-scale multi-center, adaptive platform trialsâ€“ REMAPCAP, EU-SolidAct and DisCoVeRy. When these are combined, they will encompass around 200 trial sites across half of the EU member states. Another early initiative in this context is VACCELERATEâ€“the first EU-wide network for COVID vaccine trials, which is collaborating with EMA to ensure these trials provide relevant evidence fast for a marketing authorization assessment, and is currently designing three trials that aim to inform future COVID vaccination strategies. HERA envisages that all these networks will be brought together into \"a large-scale EU platform for multi-center clinical trials to avoid fragmentation.\"But as officials also acknowledge, these trials are demonstrating yet again how hurdles relating to innovative trial designs, long regulatory approval processes and complex site administration lead to delays and underachievement. These must be tackled at European and national level to guarantee the availability of the best clinical management options, they recognize. \"Efforts are needed to better address identified barriers and challenges, to ensure the necessary agility and speed of large-scale multi-country trials across the EU,\" according to an invitation to an official EU meeting planned for October to seek solutions and to build \"increased and mutual trust with regard to the implementation of adaptive platform trials.\"Wider than COVIDIn parallel to these specifically COVID-related activities, there are plenty of moves within the European clinical trials community to explore and expand understanding of the challenges of matching clinical trials design to the exigencies and opportunities of scientific advances. The European drug industry worked on complex clinical trials in 2020 with researchers in the European Organization for Research into Treatments for Cancer and specialists in the Association of Clinical Research Organizations, as well as with the European Union\\'s Clinical Trial Expert Group, composed of national health ministry officials. This built-in part upon the 2019 recommendation paper on the initiation and conduct of complex clinical trials from the Clinical Trial Facilitation and Coordination Group, a working group of the EU Heads of Medicines Agencies, which covered enrichment designs, adaptive designs, master protocols, and use of historical controls in clinical trials. The EMA Regulatory Science Strategy to 2025 finalized in March 2020 also recognized the need to foster innovation in clinical trials as a priority focus areaâ€“a position supported further by Europe\\'s national medicines agencies\\' network in their strategy to 2025.Meanwhile, an EU-funded research project with industry inputâ€“EU-PEARLâ€“is one of several aiming to make clinical trials more efficient and patient friendly, through adaptive platforms which allow multiple companies to test their candidate drugs simultaneously against a shared placebo group. It is exploring how an adaptive platform trial with a single master protocol can allow new treatment groups to be added at any time, and candidate drugs that prove ineffective to be dropped. Other similarly-funded EU projects include ADAPT SMART, looking at evidence generation throughout the product life cycle and making best use of real world/registry data, GetReal, which is focused on including RWE in drug development using innovative trial designs, and EPAD, which is pioneering a flexible adaptive design for Alzheimerâ€™s disease treatments.Wider than EuropeOn a broader geographic scale, the US FDA Complex Innovative Trial Design Pilot Program was set up in 2018, and in 2019 FDA released final guidance on Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics. The US-based Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative is developing resources that will guide the appropriate use of the master protocols on which complex trials depend. And the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is developing guidelines on Adaptive Clinical Trials with a timeline of 2023, and on Good Clinical Practice Renovation to address the increasing diversity of clinical trial designs and data sources.Â\\xa0And in September the University of Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation organized a workshop on Complex Innovative Trial Design in Advancing the Development of Pediatric Therapeutics to discuss opportunities for leveraging complex and innovative trial designs, and to develop solutions on overcoming challenges, particularly in the use of bridging biomarkers in extrapolation and of Bayesian techniques in pediatric studies.It is against this background that the European drug industry is sponsoring a multi-stakeholder workshop in October to develop shared solutions for the use of complex clinical trials to optimize drug development in Europe. As the industry grouping EFPIA says, \"Complex clinical trials have the potential to accelerate drug development and enable patients to get timely access to transformative therapies.\" Its workshop is aiming to develop shared solutions in terms of simplified and standardized definitions, and in agreed responses to the challenges faced by regulators, health technology assessment bodies and payers, academia, patientsâ€™ organizations and industry. It hopes to define action plans to gain acceptance of complex trials supporting regulatory decision-making. The need may be obvious, but the sempiternal diversity of approaches to healthâ€“and particularly to medicinesâ€“in Europe may make achieving the objective more elusive than merely agreeing the agenda.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Medications donâ€™t work for patients who donâ€™t take them â€“ C. Everest Koop1The above statement may sound as a no-brainer. Unfortunately, medication adherence continues to remain one of the biggest healthcare challenges not only for commercially available treatments but also for Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) in clinical trials. Research has shown that, across all therapeutic areas, adherence rates drop by 40% within a year of clinical trial commencement.Incorrect medication intake can pose multiple risks such as sub-optimal therapeutic effects, higher chance of side effects, increased use of medical resources, or even incorrect assessments and conclusions for the Investigational Medicinal Products with an early termination of potential life-saving compounds.2,3Physicians too have limited to no real-time insights into the activities at home, and hence incorrect intake is picked up only during the next interaction or a few even go unnoticed. This can have a significant impact on the safety and health of patients.While patient medication adherence has its set of challenges, life sciences organizations worldwide too are grappling with a highly complex and convoluted medication process that involves multiple stakeholders, isolated systems, manual, and often paper-based processes resulting in a labor-intensive, costly, and error-prone process. To give an example, 20-25% of on-site monitoring activities are linked with IMP handlings including verifying documents related to kit receipt, dispensing, return, destruction, manual pill counts, patient medication diaries, and so on. Inadequate drug accountability is attributed as one of the top five major inspection findings4,5 behind inadequate patient medication adherence.In addition, IMPs are traditionally prepared at the study level requiring overage calculations to ensure sufficient stock at a global level. This, coupled with the regular needs for relabeling, (i.e., linked with new IMP stability data) results in significant supply waste. Studies have shown that typically at least 20-40% of prepared IMPs are never used by a patient.6,7And lastly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the already complex medication flows have been further disrupted. Alternative delivery methods to ship IMPs directly to the patientâ€™s home or local pharmacies were put in place to ensure continued access to study drug. Virtual mechanisms to explain dosing regimen, digital enablement for medication intake and verification, involvement of home nurses, etc. are just a few examples of methodologies that were embraced in a record time to ensure continuity. Many of these technologies are not new but were unable to pass the prototype stage pre-COVID, as there were always the big â€œwhat ifâ€\\x9d, â€œcan we do thisâ€\\x9d, â€œshow me your business model/ROIâ€\\x9d questions that halted broader roll out.In this article, we will get a flavor of what the next generation medication management in clinical trials should entail and share some insights on smart technologies and synergistic partnerships, backed by real-life implementation use cases. We shall look at three key tenets to enable smart medication management:Personalized patient supportIntegrated medication ecosystemFlexible medication processesÂ\\xa0Personalized patient supportComplicated treatment regimen, complex and difficult-to-understand medication instructions, limited to no personalized support, and lack of real-time insights into the happenings at home are just a few factors that can increase patient non-adherence.2,3 To give an example, currently multilingual medication booklet labels are used as standard in clinical trials. These medication booklet labels usually run up to 60 pages with each official language in any country requiring a separate label, the print font is extremely small, and information shared is incomplete (e.g., for dosing instructions, the patient needs to consult another document). It is therefore no surprise that patients have a hard time understanding and complying to medication instructions. Many booklet labels are hence returned unopened by patients.7But the good news is that many smart technology investments and cross-industry partnerships have happened in this area enabling a more patient-tailored approach.Personalized notifications specifying details of when and how to consume the medication, multimedia tools such as hands-on and easy-to-understand instructions and educational videos in patientâ€™s native language, accessible anytime, anywhere, using their own smartphone can guide patients in a personalized way throughout their medication intake journey.Digitalized, all-in-one medication labels combining data from different sources, and real-time label updates is another example of a smart solution that has been highly commended by patients.8 Real-time insight for the sites of patientâ€™s understanding in label updates can also be highly beneficial in case of critical communications such as early study termination9 or medication recalls.In addition, medication packages too can be of great support for patients to adhere to their dosing regimen. For example, smart packagesâ€”which are the traditional medication packages supplemented with electronic circuits, chips, and sensorsâ€”can track and verify medication intake till the individual pill or unit level and trigger alerts in case of inconsistencies to patients and sites.10,11,12 As an instance, in a Phase II Alzheimer study using smart blisters, a participant performed a wrong intake (he erroneously doubled his intake since he had forgotten his previous intake), that was immediately picked up and alerted by the system to site who could then connect and intervene directly with the patient.9Such advanced medication tools can also be used to trigger motivational messages based on thresholds, or prompt specific questions in case of incorrect dosage or intake outside the allowed time window, or even identify behavioral changes and prevent potential cases of dropout.Age and use of technology are often also raised as an area of concern. While younger people are believed to be more familiar with technology, studies have shown that elderly patients too are quite open and supportive of these technologies even if they have had limited to no prior experience with smartphone.8,9 Easy-to-use and simple features supported by clear and easy-to-understand training material is an important pre-requisite for elderly patients. In such population, medication compliance also remains very high (+90%) even after six months as exhibited in a recent study conducted for the elderly Asian population, by leveraging personalized patient notifications and support.10And lastly, involving relatives or caregivers of a patient, and providing them with a read-only app or allowing them to perform certain activities on behalf of patient has also found to be very useful and highly recommended.Integrated medication ecosystemsThe erstwhile medication process is fractious involving several stakeholders, isolated systems and is often guided by a paper-based, manual approach involving hand-offs between multiple stakeholders. These include Contract Manufacturer Organizations (CMOs), depots, pharmacies, couriers, Interactive Response Technology (IRT) / Randomization & Trial Supply Management (RTSM) suppliers, medication destruction facilities in addition to clinical site personnel for dispensing and the patientsâ€”the most critical stakeholdersâ€”for intake.3The process silos introduce a lot of inefficiencies and gaps in the process and are very labor-, time-and cost-intensive. What if there was a mechanism to integrate and interconnect all systems and stakeholders and ensure automated and seamless flow among diverse activities? What if all partners could have a real-time view of the medication processâ€”where, what, and when? Or what if medication packages could automatically control parameters such as temperature, storage condition, etc. and alert sites and patients in case of concerns?Recent advancements have shown that the above futuristic scenarios arenâ€™t mere concepts anymore but are already becoming a reality. Collaboration between various technology, medication suppliers and pharma companies has enabled the creation of unified and integrated web portals and apps for patients and sites with real-time data flows, analysis, and insights.13,14,15System integrations too can improve the data quality and integrity and pick up errors that might hitherto have gone undetected. For instance, in a recent study conducted for top-three pharma, a real-time RTSM integration with a barcode medication scanning tool resulted in an elimination of 10 kit assignment errors per month.13Smart packages, that can measure temperature and storage conditions in real-time, or individual pill / unit removal as explained in previous section, can also have a significant impact with eliminating many of the manual, time, and cost-consuming activities. For example, the entire drug accountability overview or specific forms such as site medication destruction forms or prescription forms (a regular ask for direct to patient supplies) can be automatically generated from the system with one click. Reports have shown that â€˜Temperature Out of Rangeâ€™ error in shipments can count for 13 billion/year leading to a total loss of up to $35 billion/year considering the cost to replace and labor involved.16While anytime, anyplace real-time insights on medication flows can bring significant value, having a secure stakeholder-based access management protocol in place is also an absolute necessity. For example, in direct-to-patient medication shipment scenarios, patientâ€™s address and contact details can be securely stored in the system after participantâ€™s consent is obtained but access must be strictly controlled. Only specific stakeholders such as courier services and home nurses can have access to these Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which at the end of the study should also be permanently deleted from the system.Flexible medication processesFlexibility is a key word that we have learnt and put in practice at all levels and in a record time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients who were unable to travel owing to the social distancing norms, still needed to have access to life-saving drugs. As a result, alternative approaches combining technology and partnerships were put in place.Tracking and verifying kit flows between different entities using simple technologies such as kit barcode or QR scanning have been implemented along the entire medication flow (e.g., Contract Manufacturing Organization, depot, sites, local pharmacy) even till the level of the patient confirming the right kit delivery by the courier using his/her own smartphone. Even implementing uber-like real-time notificationsâ€”providing insight into where the medication kit isâ€”are items that are being considered.Also offering sites the capability to define, even at an individual visit level whether the medication kit will be picked up or provided at the site, or shipped by courier to the patientâ€™s home, or the local pharmacy, is another example of flexibility being introduced.Flexibility to use alternative processes in case of issues is another example. For example, in case scanning technologies are not working, typing manual kit numbers should be available. Or in case the patient cannot confirm the receipt of courier delivery using his/her smartphone, the site can perform this activity remotely.Lastly, introducing flexibility in the medication process was also a key ask even prior COVID. For example, providing sites with the ability to postpone treatments based on results (e.g., oncology treatments) and having digital engagements automatically updated to temporarily pause medication reminders and diary completion. Or even providing sites with the ability to combine medication handouts in line with patientâ€™s holiday plans are just a few examples of flexible medication processes.The way forwardThe possibilities of combining technology and partnership are endless but as with all novel processes, change management cannot be underestimated. Involving all stakeholders early and through the entire process i.e., from the design of the tool is highly recommended and proves extremely valuable in the long run.Understandably, it wonâ€™t be a one size fits all approach and human interaction remains an important cog. Technology can never replace the site-patient interaction but can play a pioneering role in improving this relationship. Technology also doesnâ€™t possess a magic wand to resolve all challenges, with medication regimen sometimes just not being realistic, requiring life science companies to go back to the drawing board and rethink.In addition, to level up with the dynamic environment, new capabilities such as voice enabled packages, drones for drug delivery, personalized medicine, are being constantly explored and prototyped.All of us understand that adoption of digital technologies in activities pertaining to medication in clinical trials has lagged for multitude of reasons including GMP ecosystem, lack in maturity of modern technologies, lack of guidelines etc. However, the COVID-19 pandemic situation has compelled us to break traditional silos and identify and implement novel approaches for carrying out medication management, placing patient at the center of care. Going back to the days of yore with manual approach governing limited patient and site support, fragmented ecosystems, non-integrated and rigid systems is a thing of past! As we enter the next generation of medication management fueled by innovative technologies and symbiotic partnerships, we can realize preventive, augmented, and embedded smart medication management.

              "  'D': 'Clinical trial inclusion in the biopharmaceutical industry had been driven primarily by federal initiatives. However, there seems to be a renewed strategy in big pharma to incorporate diversity inclusion in clinical trials. For example, Eli Lilly has discussed its clinical trial diversity inclusion strategies, which seems to be driven by social injustice. Now, Genentech/Roche is taking on diversity inclusion as a socially responsible strategy. In this interview, Nicole Richie, Global Head Health Equity and Population Science at Genentech/Roche, will discuss her perspectives on the topic.Moe Alsumidaie: Can you tell me why Genentech formed the Advancing Inclusive Research Site Alliance, and what was the motivation behind this? What sparked this initiative, and why now?Nicole Richie: We started this work several years ago with the appreciation that clinical trials are homogeneous and that the majority of patients included in clinical trials are of one race, and ancestral backgroundâ€”only five to 15% are not Caucasian. A couple of reasons this was front of mind was, for one, the United States demographics are shiftingâ€”we are becoming a more diverse and minority-majority nation. The second element that caused more of an increased focus internally was that we thought about personalized healthcare and invested in that as a pharmaceutical company. With that came this burgeoning awareness in the clinical and scientific communities that genetic and clinical data are homogeneous.All of the information thatâ€™s readily available to us is limited. And the implications of that as we try to develop more and more personalized treatments are significant. It undermines our ability to have more personalized care. And so there was just this kind of bolus of publications and literature around this.That tipped us into having more of a discrete focus on this work back in 2017. As it evolved, we realized that one of the mechanisms to have more representation in research is by having sites in the right location, with the right capabilities and the proper outreach into patient communities. That is where this focus on an Alliance model was born. It was intended to create an infrastructure that will allow for sustainable and durable commitment and a building of partnerships to have more representative patients in our trials and our research environment. We started with four sites, with the aspiration of having a network that ultimately serves these cohort centers of excellence and partners with us to achieve our aspirations for diversity in clinical research.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0MA: How does that fit with Genentechâ€™s overall product development strategy? You mentioned personalized medicine, and of course, Genentech is big on oncology. Does that have something to do with that? Or is it more of a federal or social mandate that youâ€™re following?Â\\xa0Â\\xa0NR: It is to bring more representation into our clinical trials and to bring greater real-world data cohorts, both clinical and omic, into our strategies and planning and our process that informs our personalized healthcare approach. And then to partner strategically across the healthcare ecosystem with the appreciation that this is a big challenge, and we have to come together in different ways to integrate new solutions.This work, in general, is about having more representation in our research programs. Roche is fully supportive and synergistic with our aspirations for personalized healthcare, as they align with many of Rocheâ€™s vision as a pharmaceutical company to impact patientsâ€™ lives. By moving into a more comprehensive solutions-based approach, and not a transactional medicine, we we can impact patient care in an end-to-end manner.Then, we also think about what our impact on society is. So we are asking questions like, â€œHow do we reduce the burden for society?â€\\x9d Healthcare costs are unsustainable, and this is not a new problem, but as institutions and stakeholders continue to move more and more towards value-based care, these types of solutions and integrating the totality of health becomes front and center to what a pharmaceutical company needs to focus on.So as such, this is a crucial component to broadening the lens on who informs our science and medicine and who benefits from our innovations. And itâ€™s also coupled with our â€œBench to Bedsideâ€\\x9d efforts that are happening across the organization. So it is the research endeavors, but also making sure that we partner holistically with the access pathways to ensure that weâ€™re bringing not just research, but enabling science understanding in under-studied patient populations and ensuring that patients get served in new ways and have access to these innovations.MA: What does the diversity currently look like with Genentechâ€™s trials, and what milestones do you have to increase the diversity, and what does that mean for clinical trials?NR: Currently, you can look at the last new molecular entities that were published on FDA Snapshots. The metrics are getting better, and the most recent NMEs were approved with the caveat that these are global trials and comprised of different countries enrolling at different rates. So what used to be upwards of 90% of all European or white patient demographics has moved to around 75%, and in some cases even less than that.So that population thatâ€™s growing in some cases is through China. We are doing more and more studies in China, and weâ€™re bringing in more Asian patient populations. We still have much work to do, I would say, in bringing in African American and Black patients and Latin and Hispanic patients, both in the US and Latin America, for example.The demographics of the studies have to be viewed within what recruitment occurs in the US versus outside of the US if we compare to US metrics. So, for example, in our most recent geocentric approval, the representation of US recruitment is very much in alignment with what you would expect for the epidemiology of disease. However, if you look at the whole global population, it gets diluted that the minority of patients come from the US.It is contextual as we think about benchmarking and baselining. We are using epidemiology as our metric of what weâ€™re trying to drive towards. We are putting together an understanding of where we were before, so looking at that historic recruitment is a first them. Then, our goal will ultimately be to align to the epidemiology of disease and what we would expect based on demographics. Those are the metrics weâ€™re trying to achieve as we think about what â€œgoodâ€\\x9d looks like. This is a long process because recruitment, depending on what therapeutic area youâ€™re talking about, takes several years of integrating mitigations or implementing new tactics that, over time, move the needle.We have seen some great examples in our EMPACTA study. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it included patient populations in the US. Approximately 84% of patients were non-White and from places worldwide, including Latin America and Africa, and in the US like the Navajo nation and New Orleans, where patients were disproportionately affected by the disease.We had to show with that study that itâ€™s possible, and we can find these patients. If we can do it in a global pandemic, Iâ€™m sure we can think about how to do it more holistically. So many learnings have come from that. There have been several proofs of concepts that have shown what we can achieve. Now it is a matter of how we bring it into the whole totality of the lifecycle of development.MA:Â\\xa0I understand you have global partner trial sites. Can you tell me more about those partner trial sites and how they are working successfully to include diversity while also de-risking it as much as possible?NR: Absolutely. That is undoubtedly the plan. We launched the first-ever oncology industry study in Kenya this year. So there are sites that have that high rigor and that fidelity that is necessary, but we donâ€™t typically think about them in that way. From the global vantage point, weâ€™ve been thinking about where those patient populations are particularly understudied. So you end up in Latin America, Africa, India, these vast regions. With the appreciation that, to your point, we have to have an infrastructure that serves us.In a similar manner that we have established the Advancing Inclusive Research Site Alliance model in the US, we are looking at how we can do something thatâ€™s probably quite different in the actual tactical planning but has the same intentionality. So that we again create this infrastructure that is a center of excellence and has fidelity, conveys trust, and creates partnerships that can be forged over time and then maintained.The other thing weâ€™re looking at is how Europe and the UK are rapidly diversifying, in certain regions more than others. So really, it takes much global strategy with local implementation and information, which is typically how we do things. So it fits right into our current operating model.MA: Can you tell me about the disparities in clinical trials? What can the pharmaceutical industry essentially do to bridge that gap? Or at least try to bring that gap together through bringing those innovative and breakthrough medical products to those patients?NR: I think there are a couple of elements. As a pharmaceutical company, we can intervene in many ways from a research and data generation perspective. We are moving into real-world data and other forms of information that we can use to supplement and facilitate our understanding of populations that have almost entirely been understudied and left behind by science and medicine.There is a commitment to leveraging more considerable data assets to generate insights and contribute to scientific discourse in a new way.Â\\xa0Weâ€™re trying to achieve population-specific medical elements based on the appreciation that disease affects populations differently. For example, there are well-known variations in clinical course and even response to therapy due to therapeutics attributed to race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry.As a science company, we have to get the science right. But, we also have to think about health equity, access, and the totality of health. I think thatâ€™s deeply at our intersection of how we think about personalized healthcare.Because research is just one piece of the broader health continuum, there is a leadership element to showing and setting industry standards on addressing health equity.We must partner in new ways across the ecosystem, which we currently do in many different avenues through charitable giving, for example. We also do so through our External Council on inclusive research and health equity, which includes key opinion leaders that are very established in the health equity space representing healthcare professionals and patient advocacy groups and organizations.Our role as aÂ\\xa0biotechnology company is twofold. Firstly, it is to get the research and the science right, increasing the clinical utility and results generation. Secondly, we need to make sure that we address access deprivation and the channels needed to ensure that patients are getting access to our medicines.We also have to put a line in the sand with public declarations of our intention, hoping that we will instill that in other companies. Because it will take all of us coming into this space to achieve more remarkable health outcomes for more patients. Ultimately itâ€™s also to mobilize the industry and enterprise at large.MA: The Advancing Inclusive Research Site Alliance is one of the many examples of what Genentech is doing as a trailblazer in the industry. How do you anticipate that the biopharmaceutical industry will also change to address diversity?NR: Hopefully, this is setting the standards. We are very active in pharma trade organizations and other cross-industry collaborations, and we are even publishing our approach and methodology. For example, the Advancing Inclusive Research Site Alliance announcement shared how weâ€™re thinking and what infrastructure and foundational elements weâ€™re putting in place are serving us well.One of the things I like about our approach is that it is very much in Genentech fashion to partner with experts. So this is where again the External Council comes in. We have these incredible minds who have been in this space for decades and can help challenge us and inform our process. So there are tangible outcomes from that.For example, on the council, we have an incredible multiple sclerosis (MS) clinician who has observed that the clinical course and outcomes look different in Hispanic and Black patients. So, as a result, we now have a study called CHIMES to address this specific hypothesis in Black and Hispanic patients. It goes to show that in pure Genentech fashion, weâ€™re harnessing the best and the brightest because we know that this is bigger than just one company. We understand that this is a substantial multifaceted challenge, and we have the humility to say that that is the case.There is no magic bullet. This takes much learning and much iteration, and itâ€™s probably different across disease areas, as weâ€™ve come to appreciate as well.I think the leadership element of this also comes in the fact that we resource it. I have a team of people that focus on this that serve this work globally. Quita Highsmith, our Chief Diversity Officer, has a strategic pillar concentrated on this. Thereâ€™s a US medical affairs group focused on health equity and inclusive research. Both of our research institutions in Genentech and Roche have cross-functional teams that have come together around this. So I think it all comes back to giving it time, space, money, and funding.Moe Alsumidaie, MBA, MSF, is a thought leader and expert in the application of business analytics toward clinical trials, and Editorial Advisory Board member for and regular contributor to Applied Clinical Trials.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'In an important step for modernizing drug formulation and biopharmaceutical development, FDA is launching a program to test the safety and suitability of novel inactive ingredients for use in new drugs and biologics. This final initiative, first proposed two years ago, supports a two-year pilot program to test up to four new excipients likely improve the effectiveness and safety of important new drugs.1 The aim is to encourage sponsors of clinical trials to formulate innovative therapies with those new excipients that FDA finds acceptable for use under this program.FDA spelled out the pilot program in a Federal Register notice published Sept. 8, 2021.2 The agency explains that the initiative is open to novel excipients that have not been used previously in food or in FDA-approved products and how excipient manufacturers looking to participate should submit information by Dec. 7, 2021 on the novel inactive ingredient and its potential for enhancing public health. The program aims to evaluate four selected novel excipients likely to advance drug development, such as by increasing solubility for an oral formulation taken chronically. Those ingredients authorized under this program then may be used in the formulation for an experimental drug slated for clinical trials, provided that the sponsor demonstrates that it is safe for use in that specific treatment. After FDA approves a new drug or biologic utilizing the new excipient, that ingredient then would be added to FDAâ€™s Inactive Ingredient Database, making it available for use by other manufacturers, including those producing generic drugs.Manufacturers of drugs and biologics, as well as excipient developers, have long sought a process for FDA to evaluate new inactive ingredients prior to use in a new drug or biologic to support the development of innovative formulations without fear of delay or complications in FDA review and approval of the new product. Biopharma companies support this effort to avoid difficulties in formulating innovative drugs with available, established excipients, for example, in looking to stabilize proteins in new formulations. Excipient makers similarly acknowledge that they would be more willing to invest in production and characterization of novel excipients if itâ€™s possible to gain FDA review of the productâ€™s benefits outside of clinical testing for a new molecular entity. The initiative, as well as ongoing efforts to set international standards for excipient use, have potential to enhance drug formulation and support modern manufacturing and quality control efforts.Referenceshttps://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/novel-excipient-review-pilot-program?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdeliveryhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/08/2021-19335/center-for-drug-evaluation-and-research-office-of-new-drugs-novel-excipient-review-pilot-program'},\n",

              "  'C': 'Insights from sponsors conducting global DCTs and provide guidance for how best to plan and execute effective eCOA strategies.',\n",
              "  'D': 'It is widely accepted that electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOA) are the preferred means of collecting participant data. In traditionally designed, site-based studies, eCOA has proven to be an effective method for capturing high-quality data while meeting all necessary regulatory requirements. Today, the use of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) and electronic clinician-reported outcomes (eClinROs), two of the most utilized eCOAs across all studies and all therapeutic areas, are commonplace.While many eCOAs are still taken during in-person clinic visits, the flexibility of the electronic platforms. This allows study teams to gather participant data, including regular quality-of-life measures, more frequently and cost-effectively while maintaining compliance.Â\\xa0Digital collection and submission of outcome assessments are a natural fit for todayâ€™s decentralized clinical trials (DCTs). One of the key advantages of DCTs is the ability to expand participant recruitment beyond the geographical limitations common in site-based clinical studies. This allows sponsors to reach a much wider range of participants, including those living in rural areas located great distances from study center hospitals. This is significant, with more than 70% of clinical trial participants living two or more hours away from a study center. This is obviously beneficial for those seeking to conduct large, global studies while finding the most inclusive group of participants possible and is particularly useful for recruiting and enrolling optimized participant groups for rare disease trials. With DCTs, eCOA is useful in monitoring and managing participants spread out over great distances, as remote assessments help to minimize the number of in-person visits.That said, global DCTs also present specific challenges for eCOA that should be considered and addressed in order to ensure study success. This paper will discuss learnings and insights from sponsors conducting global DCTs and provide guidance for how best to plan and execute effective eCOA strategies.eCOA challenges in global DCTsSecurityData security is a challenge for all industries that process and store data digitally. A recent poll taken of stakeholders in the clinical trials industry showed that 32% of respondents reported that concerns about data security was their primary barrier to using more digital technologies in clinical research.Â\\xa0For DCTs and hybrid studies to work efficiently, data needs to be captured remotely from participants and other users, increasing both the risk of data incidents and the need for effective controls to maintain data integrity.In order to keep data secure, numerous regulations and laws exist around the world that spell out the various approaches that need to be taken and safeguards that need to be in place. In healthcare, where data including personal health information is particularly sensitive, strict regulations must be acknowledged and followed. These regulations vary from country to country.This can be a challenge for global trials, as the regulations for each country in which a participant lives must be adhered to. For example, in trials where participants live exclusively in the United States, all eCOA activityâ€”ranging from participant-entered data to assessments recorded during telehealth visits, must be compliant with patient privacy regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). For trials that involve participants living in the European Union and United Kingdom, GDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is an even more strict set of regulations designed to keep all personal data (not only health-related information) of EU citizens private and secure. GDPR equivalent regulations are now in place within Asia Pacific countries as well.Culture and language differencesWhen conducting global clinical trials, there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all eCOA. For each country represented by participants in a study, eCOA must be available in the appropriate languages and dialects. To maintain content validity, there needs to be a consistent presentation for all languages. Simply translating from one language to another is not realisticâ€”validated eCOA has approved translations for use which have gone through rigorous equivalence testing. Thought must be given to how each language will reflect in the presentation of the eCOA instrument and how this will be impacted on screens ranging in size from smartphone screens to laptop and desktop monitors. Each language must be presented in a way that maintains the validity and intuitiveness and ease-of-use of eCOA applications. At the same time, content needs to mirror how the user actually speaks while avoiding terms or words that might be offensive in certain regions of specific countries. In any case where a translation does not exist, and where approval of the new language is not required by the scale author (e.g., questionnaires, surveys, eDiaries, etc.), it is useful to seek out translation vendors who can provided linguistic validation to ensure that the proper meaning and intent of the content is in place.The translation process should not be underestimated; such processes can be complex. Choosing experienced vendors to manage this process on your behalf can simplify the experience for you and reduce or eliminate any potential language-specific user issues. Following is an example of a translation workflow for eCOA:Initial Translation: The source content and, more importantly, the context around the intent of how the content will be used is shared with the translator, who then translates the content (preserving meaning and intent) into the desired languageLinguistic Validation: Localized dialect experts ensure that the translation is optimized for the intended target populationEdit of the Initial Translation: The Forward Translation is reviewed and edited (as necessary) by a different translatorReverse Translation: The final version is translated back into the source language and checked to ensure that the original intent and meaning of the content are preservedFinal Version Submitted for Review to all relevant parties, including Sponsor and Clinical team membersThese steps will need to be repeated for every languageâ€”and dialect of each languageâ€”involved in the study. For large, widespread global studies, this is quite an undertaking. The right translation vendor, again, can help manage and simplify this process.eCOA and telehealthDespite the previously mentioned challenges, eCOA is an accepted interface for global data collection and is a standard feature within DCT. eCOA can be conducted in a variety of ways while maintaining the â€œfit-for-purposeâ€\\x9d validation requirements set by regulators. For example, a majority of eCOA can be conducted via virtual telehealth visits that are device agnostic, do not require provisioned devices, and allow the users (participants, caregivers, home health nurse, etc.) to be anywhere while conducting the assessment. This adds flexibility to the process while meeting all eCOA license holder requirements such as user interface specifications, form factor restrictions, and process steps.eCOA, combined with specialized telehealth platforms can digitally recreate much of the in-person visit experience. Using the video and audio recording capabilities of a standard handheld device, for example, assessments of participant movement and vocal characteristics can be made remotely.Best practices for eCOA in global DCTsTo realize the benefits of eCOA in global decentralized and hybrid trials, we must overcome the security, privacy and user-related challenges discussed earlier. Having helped sponsors and CROs (contract research organizations) perform hundreds of DCTs over the years, THREAD has developed some best practices for how to optimize eCOA in these studies.Seek out systems with built-in privacy and securityCountries around the world present different sets of regulations regarding data security and privacy. Some are more stringent than others, so it is important to ensure that any software or platform vendors adhere to the most stringent regulations across your trial portfolio, irrespective of where any one single study is being conducted. eCOA platforms that are designed from the ground up with this in mind can help to address these differences. For example, GDPR is one of the strictest sets of restrictions regarding personal data in the world. By developing an eCOA platform that meets the strict standards of GDPR, a vendor will also meet or exceed any other sets of less-stringent regulations used in other parts of world. An example would be a vendor who utilizes advanced tokenization strategies to effectively mask all personally identifiable information (PII). Tokenization is a process by which PII is collected, only when necessary, directly from the participant and then immediately tokenizedâ€”or maskedâ€”and encrypted. In this way, all participant identification data is obscured immediately and completely.Going digital also raises concerns around what security standards are applied to your data sets and what measures need to be taken to minimize data incidents. Choosing platforms built from the beginning with a cloud infrastructure can protect data from breaches.Provide localized expertise and support to help global DCT eCOA run smoothly, study leaders should involve local experts and support in the regions of the world where participants are located. This helps to mitigate regional challenges like navigating country-specific regulations, different languages and dialects, and cultural norms.Local knowledge enables sponsorsâ€”and any vendors helping them to conduct studiesâ€”to be aware of any changes in the regulatory landscape before they occur. This is essential to keeping each region involved in a global trial running smoothly.Language translation and use of correct regional dialects are much easier to achieve if you have native speakers on the ground in those areas. These professionalsâ€”who can be employees or contractorsâ€”can help to confirm that the language has been accurately translated in a way that preserves the intent and meaning of the eCOA application while respecting any and all relevant cultural idiosyncrasies of the participant population. This is true for eCOA application content, of course, but also is necessary for all participant/user study materials including training manuals, interface user guides, process walkthroughs and more.Region-based support is critical for participants and other users (caregivers, clinicians, etc.) who may need assistance with the applications, the devices, or other challenges associated with their eCOA responsibilities. Providing access to expert support in the native language and dialect helps to solve issues quickly and keep participants on track.Use participant-friendly, intuitive technologiesEasy-to-use technologies are a must for successful eCOA in any type of study. For global studies, intuitive interfaces are critical to keeping the stream of eCOA data flowing. Comprehensive applications anticipate the most common needs of users and offer a focused user interface similar to those found in the kinds of consumer applications that the study population is already familiar and comfortable with. Intuitive interfaces reduce the need for user training and minimize the potential for human error. Structured screen presentation helps to onboard new users, guiding them through instructional screens that serve to educate them on what is required for study participation.Â\\xa0Moving later into the study, the same kind of screen flow and support functions help guide the eCOA process itself.Offer built-in, on-demand user supportAnother advantage of electronic assessment applications is their ability to house a wealth of easily accessible support content. Users can access content like videos, diagrams, or text on a variety of topics, such as:Device/application trainingAnswers to frequently encountered questionsEducation on their condition and symptomsWhen to and how to schedule a telehealth visitHandheld devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are particularly useful at providing bite-sized content. This utility is a perfect fit for providing clinical trial participants and other users of eCOA applications, quick, image-heavy resources to support them over the course of a study. This helps them to address potential issues before they become problems and can help reduce the need for clinical team outreach, saving time and cost.Chris WatsonÂ\\xa0is the Director of Consulting for THREAD'},\n",

              "  'D': 'As part of a broad initiative to prepare for and prevent future global disease outbreaks, White House officials recently announced a nearly $3 billion program to ramp up production of vaccines and their components to better serve patients in the U.S. and globally. This program is part of a broader $65 billion, 10-year pandemic preparedness plan announced Sept. 3 that also supports development of new therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as improved infectious disease surveillance, expansion of the national stockpile of critical medical supplies, and building regulatory oversight of these programs.1The roll-out of the preparedness plan was an opening salvo in the administrationâ€™s heightened effort to increase vaccination rates and testing to keep schools open, strengthen the economy, and defeat the virus globally. In a national speech Sept. 9, 2021, President Biden promised additional steps for providing protections for other countries and promised to release more details of his pandemic preparedness plan in coming weeks.2Meanwhile, the Biden administration looks to start the more targeted program to bolster vaccine production in the U.S. by tapping an already approved $2.7 billion in funding authorized last March. This effort was announced by White House coronovirus response coordinator Jeffrey Zients at a press briefing on Sept. 2, 2021, called to provide an update on U.S. efforts to ramp up production of anti-COVID-19 vaccines for patients in the U.S. and in other countries. Zients announced that the U.S. has shipped more than 130 million doses to 90 countries, more than all other vaccine doses than all other countries in the world combined.3 However, even that greater volume of vaccines provided to the global community remains a fraction of the billions of doses that health officials say are needed.Zients emphasized the importance of increasing vaccine manufacturing capacity at home and in other countries around the world by investing across the whole supply chain, from producing lipids to bioreactor bags to vials and syringes. He noted that the Biden administration has tapped funds already available to accelerate production â€œof critical vaccine manufacturing equipment, inputs and suppliesâ€\\x9d and to expand â€œfill-finish lines at factoriesâ€\\x9d to get vaccine doses into vials faster and at a larger scale. The added $3 billion, he noted, will enable vaccine manufacturers to â€œadd new production lines and facilities.â€\\x9d And this will create â€œthousands of good-paying American jobsâ€\\x9d and â€œstrengthen our long-term capabilities to respond to future threats.â€\\x9dThe White House unveiled its broader $65 billion pandemic preparedness plan the next day, as mentioned above, which lays out long-term strategies for expanding vaccine and drug manufacturing and for building a biomedical research pipeline as key components for quickly responding to future disease outbreaks. Described as similar to the Apollo mission to the moon, both public health and national security experts called for a â€œmission controlâ€\\x9d office to coordinate efforts by multiple government agencies to track and identify emerging disease threats and map strategies for combatting them. Administration officials proposed launching the program with an initial $15 billion budget as the debate over Biden spending proposals has stalled on Capitol Hill.For the total program, more than half of the $65 million request would fund efforts to design and test new vaccines within 100 days after a pandemic threat appears and to speed production and distribution by eliminating the need for cold storage and replacing sterile injection with skin patches and nasal sprays. Rapid production of neutralizing antibodies would advance new antiviral therapeutics, and genome sequencing of patients with symptoms, wastewater sampling, and formation of early-warning data networks would enable earlier detection of viral outbreaks. The plan would expand the national stockpile to ensure access to next-generation personal protective equipment and testing equipment and build resilient supply chains for medical products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients.The program also would support the efficient regulatory approval of new platform technologies and the establishment of â€œlarge, agile and flexible clinical trials networks that can be rapidly ramped up for urgent needs.â€\\x9d Further information is presented in a â€œscientific appendixâ€\\x9d to this 27-page plan, although many health experts maintain that a much more detailed program is necessary.Referenceshttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/American-Pandemic-Preparedness-Transforming-Our-Capabilities-Final-For-Web.pdfhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-president-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/09/02/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-54/'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Observing the many digital applications available nowadays to assist in data generation and collection in the field of clinical research, has made me reflect on how differently we did this in the past. When I started my career in the industry as a clinical research physician in the early 1990s, paper was the norm. Most clinical studiesâ€™ data collection took place on paper. Investigators would fill in case report forms (CRF) using triplicate (or sometimes quadruplicate, depending on the appetite of the sponsor), which clinical research assistants would tear, distribute to the various study folders and carry back to the office. Besides the medical information included in the CRF, paper was also the primary tool for most of the patient-reported outcome data.If you were working in a disease area where one could not rely on any objective measures (eg: glycemia) but rather where the primary outcome measure for your trial was based on symptoms reported by patients on a daily basis, then you had to rely on paper collection.That is until providers began to develop digital tools that could be programmed to collect specific data, at a specific time, and provide a time stamp for data entry.Digitalâ€™s first stepsSome significant steps took place to introduce digital solutions for pre-clinical studies, data generation and collection in early Phase I studies. It suddenly became possible to generate, capture and organize healthy volunteer data automatically. This was also the time when the first electronic CRFs started to appear. Seen with todayâ€™s standards in mind, the early solutions looked a little clunky; instead of using what would now be known as cloud-based solutions, these electronic CRFs were individual computer laptops that usually belonged to the sponsor or the CRO running the study. If an investigational site was running several studies at the same time, this site may have had to store as many computers as studies. Digital solutions were also introduced in other areas, such as centralized patient assessment, image analysis and the creation of centralized reading centers.The movement to develop and introduce digital solutions in clinical trials sped up, with more sophisticated disease area-specific solutions being developed and piloted into clinical trials. For the first time, these solutions were able to objectivize and quantify biological or physiological changes related to the effect of the intervention on the disease process, and place it into the context of the real patientâ€™s life. For disease areas relying primarily on subjective outcome measures, these solutions prove invaluable. However, many of these remain add-ons to what is otherwise being used or collected in normal practice, which generates additional costs and complexity to deploy.Devices and decentralizationAll is now changing with solutions that can be fully integrated to devices most of us carry with us, like our smart phones. These devices, which follow us almost all the time, provide a goldmine of information pertaining to our functioning as individuals. They are able to observe our daily activities, in a very unbiased fashion. Coupled with disease-specific applications, the combination becomes a powerful tool to assess how we function in healthy and diseased states. This opens the door for increasingly decentralized clinical trials, with the participation of truly empowered patientsâ€“for whom clinical trials may represent an important therapeutic alternative.Over the last 30 years, digitization has fundamentally revolutionized the clinical trialsâ€™ process. Data generation, standardization and hypothesis testing capabilities have been hugely enhanced, at the same time the deployment of digital solutions has become easier. Data collection and facilitating patientsâ€™ knowledge, information and detection has also been a game changer. By combining real world evidence and disease specific measurement through increasingly powerful data analytics at an affordable cost, digital technologies have completely transformed the clinical trials landscape.Pierre Pellier, MD, CEO, CTMADownload Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'D': 'HG Wells said it best, â€œadapt or perish, now as ever, it is natureâ€™s inexorable imperative.â€\\x9d In life sciences, change is happening out of necessity to navigate COVID-19 disruptions. The pandemic brought urgency to simplify processes and keep studies going, accelerating transformation across the industry. This is especially true in clinical data management, and CROs have been at the forefront.By adopting digital strategies and technologies, CROs are embracing new ways of working to meet growing sponsor requirements and patient expectations. The improvements in collaboration and efficiency have proven what is possible, and now there is no going back.As we get closer to a post-COVID-19 world, sponsors and patients will look for the same levels of speed and agility. CROs are prepared to take on the challenge by using agile study design and artificial intelligence (AI), incorporating data from remote data sources, and enabling connected clinical processes to accelerate trial execution.Streamline data buildCOVID-19 stopped or delayed more than 2,000 clinical trials,1 exposing potential points of failure in how trials are conducted. This is true in data management, where it takes approximately 72 days for monitors to conduct onsite source data verification (SDV) for a study.2 But as trials slowed down at the height of the pandemic, new COVID-19 treatment and vaccine studies presented an opportunity for CROs to innovate and complete trials faster than ever before.With the industryâ€™s success in bringing vaccines to market in much shorter periods, sponsors expect CROs to continue the momentum and deliver faster cycle times throughout the development process. One area with significant opportunity for improvement is study start-up, where EDC study builds take a mean cycle time of 69 days from protocol approval to database go-live.3 To improve the pace, CROs are using modern clinical data management systems (CDMS) that empower teams with agile study designs.â€œWe found a lot of innovation using agile study design, where we were able to set up COVID-19 trials in just a few weeks,â€\\x9d said Trevor Griffiths, director, clinical data management at Syneos Health. â€œTo do this, we developed standards specifically for COVID-19 trials and worked hand in hand with our partners andtechnology providers.â€\\x9dUnfortunately, protocol changesâ€”which were exceedingly common in COVID-19 trialsâ€”are the top cause of build delays. In todayâ€™s climate, sponsors expect to see these changes handled quickly and efficiently. Month-long delays, manual processes, and inflexible systems are no longer acceptable, especially for mid-study changes. More CROs are adopting CDMS to eliminate downtime when making amendments, regardless of the visits and rules impacted.4Accelerate data cleaningThe use of new external data sources in trials increased during the pandemic, presenting numerous challenges for data managers. The industry is already embracing sources like real-world evidence or wearables. With studies shifting from the clinic to patient homes, alternative means of gathering data are rising. This change exacerbates the downstream issues of incorporating diverse data sets, increasing the need for solutions to manage data from disparate sources.Cleaning remains a challenge since it requires the review of a growing volume of data points. More CROs are looking for scalable, flexible technology to accelerate the process.â€œCOVID-19 kickstarted the use of AI for data cleaning, especially because we were working on massive vaccine trials with tens of thousands of subjects,â€\\x9d added Griffiths. â€œWe were able to successfully train and program AI, nearly eliminating manual review of medical data.â€\\x9dTodayâ€™s data aggregation tools, analytics solutions, and pre-built integrations are essential to making this a reality. â€œExternally, a connected approach addresses the issues of multiple sources for data but working with different functions internally requires having a strong workbench,â€\\x9d said YaFang Wu, senior director, Parexel. â€œBy using both, youâ€™re able to manage different information and paths altogether, in one single area.â€\\x9dApplying data workbench and AI strategies will help data teams perform rapid data cleaning and accelerate lock times.Remote data sourcesThe increased adoption of decentralized approaches represents a positive development in the industry, and CROs are leading the charge to enable a more patient-centric, digital clinical trial. For example, using applications for eConsent or electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) allows researchers to collect and record patient consent and clinical data digitally, making it easier to review, share, and report information.â€œWith limited access to research sites, we quickly had to adapt and implement a more patient-centric approach to bring trials to the patient,â€\\x9d said Sam Ryan, director of data management at ICON. â€œWe expect this trend will remain beyond COVID-19 to assure flexibility for patients, meaning an increase in home visits, more technology, and an explosion of data.â€\\x9dLeveraging decentralized approaches reduce the patient burden of participating in trials and ease the administrative burden on research sites. For CROs, the increase of patient information sources added complexity in managing the data produced during the trial.â€œThe explosion of data driven by decentralized approaches, like wearables and sensors, presents an opportunity to reimagine the data manager. Making roles more technical and data science-focused can ensure companies have the people to set up, oversee, and manage each interconnection and data source in a trial,â€\\x9d added Ryan.CROs are evolving their infrastructure for greater oversight and control. With the right systems and people in place, they can ensure accurate data, manage change proactively, and accelerate trials.Bringing together data and opsAs shown in Figure 1 below, CROs are advancing toward unifying their clinical systems for better visibility and oversight (70%), reduced manual processes (69%), and improved study quality (60%). A big part of achieving those improvements is connecting clinical data and trial management systems to automatically exchange new records and updates to existing subjects quickly and easily.With an integrated approach, shown in Figure 2 below, pharma companies and CROs can streamline processes like remote monitoring, allowing clinical research associates to seamlessly navigate from monitoring visits to subject case books for SDV. Bringing together data and operations increases cross-functional efficiency and visibility, enabling leaders to proactively manage studies and identify issues early on.A unified approach to clinical automates data transfers, eliminating the need for duplicate data entry and, in turn, reducing transcription errors. With a single log-in, study teams can access real-time patient enrollment and status information to speed study start-up, a critical area that accounts for 61% of total trial cycle times.5Faster, nimbler trialsLife sciences is especially adept at identifying problems, putting together new formulas, and applying learnings. COVID-19 placed the industry on a steep curve, and the lessons coming out of it have improved clinical trial processes.Sponsors and CROs have enabled more connected ways of working in studies powered by agile digital solutions. Whether onsite, decentralized, or hybrid, tomorrowâ€™s trials will be conducted in a way that is most convenient to sites and patients and will be executed by teams who have brand new skillsets. The shift is long overdue.ReferencesBerlin Institute of Health, Clinical Trials Stopped by COVID-19, 2021Applied Clinical Trials, Risk-Based Monitoring Versus Source Data Verification, 2018Tufts CSDD, Impact Report, Volume 23, Number 2, March/April 2021Veeva Systems, Bioforum The Data Masters interview, 2021Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development Impact Report, Clinical Site Initiation Process Remains Lengthy and Highly Inefficient, 2018Sid Mohamoodally, Senior Director, Strategy, Vault CDMS, Veeva SystemsDownload Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

Defined by FDA as a â€œclinical design that allows for prospectively planned modifications to one or more aspectsâ€¦based on accumulating data,â€\\x9d1 an adaptive trial can help â€œde-riskâ€\\x9d the arduous process of drug development.According to a paper in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2017, the approach is motivated by â€œboth ethical and resource considerations.â€\\x9d An integral feature of an adaptive trial is the existence of an independent data-monitoring committee (IDMC) or alternatively of a separate dedicated independent adaptation committee, to carry out interim review of accruing outcome data that allow pre-specified adaptations to be made while the trial is ongoing.There are various types of adaptive trials and of adaptations that can be proposed, each with their risks and benefits. Sample-size re-estimation (SSRE) is a family of designs that allow for increasing the sample size based on blinded or unblinded interim data analysis of randomized trials. This is important because research has shown that underpowered clinical trials, when the sample size is too small to reject the null hypothesis, is one of the common reasons a potentially efficacious drug can fail to demonstrate its worth during a study.2Sample-size calculations performed before the start of a trial require assumptions about the hypothesized treatment effect and the outcomes in each arm. Incorrect assumptions can result in a trial being underpowered or even overpowered. Both situations pose ethical and scientific concerns: either recruiting an insufficient number of patients without being able to fully answer the research question or subjecting more patients than necessary to a potentially inferior treatment when thereâ€™s already sufficient evidence to answer the research question.3 Unblinded SSRE methods assess the validity of the assumptions and enable an increase of the sample size based on the observed interim treatment effect, if necessary. Unblinded SSRE methods inherit the group sequential capacity to stop the trial early as soon as the scientific question addressed by the trial is answered.The promising-zone approachThe promising-zone SSRE method was first described by Mehta and Pocock in 2011, based on earlier work by Chen et al.4 It allows to recalculate the required sample size based on interim data, while minimizing the inevitable risks of bias and type-I error and yet, use a conventional test statistic at all stages of the study.At the last interim analysis for efficacy, the IDMC will use the observed data and the assumption that future treatment effect will follow the same trend to re-calculate the conditional power. This value will fall into one of three pre-defined zones:Unfavorable: The observed treatment effect is not sufficient to warrant the increase in sample size needed to maintain study power.Promising: The observed treatment is effect is lower than expected, but assuming the observed trend exactly reflects the true effect and that the trend continues, the power can be recovered, by increasing the sample size.Favorable: The observed treatment effect is sufficiently favorable, and no sample-size increase is needed to maintain power.It is a relatively simple approach to SSRE as it allows using a conventional test statistic at the end of the study, and, in some cases, can be very beneficial. However, it is worth noting that the promising-zone approach is not always the most optimal. It can, as all SSRE methods, introduce the risk of operational bias, and it creates additional regulatory hurdles. Moreover, the promising zone is defined on a statistical basis to enable the use a conventional test statistic, and not on clinical basis, and has been criticized for that.SSRE in practiceWhen used appropriately, this approach can confer several benefits, not least of which is the ability to salvage a slightly underpowered trial, by adjusting the sample size when interim results show a treatment effect that is somewhat smaller than anticipated.Unlike other SSRE methods, it allows the use of a standard test statistic without type-I error inflation. The promising-zone method is particularly useful for small organizations with limited upfront resources. Starting with the smallest sample size and reasonably optimistic assumptions regarding the treatment effect, they can then attract additional investment to expand the study based on promising interim data.However, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. At IDDI, we recommend sponsors to compare the risks and benefits of different forms of adaptive designs, including the more classical group-sequential designs, and select the one that best suits their individual circumstances and likely total sample size. In many cases a group-sequential design can be more advantageous than a trial with unblinded sample-size adaptations. Sponsors must also keep in mind that sample size re-estimation will be inefficient if the initial study was largely underpowered.Operational challengesWhen unblinded SSRE is the right approach, sponsors and CROs must ensure they consider and respond to some added challenges.First, the method can increase the risk of operational bias if the announcement of the SSRE conveys the anticipation of an effective treatment. To minimize that risk, itâ€™s important to tell sites to continue recruitment until asked to stop, without announcing the magnitude of the sample-size increase. Moreover, knowledge of that increase can allow â€œback-calculationâ€\\x9d of the treatment effect, which undermines the blinded nature of the interim analysis outside the circle of the IDMC.The method also comes with increased regulatory hurdles. These are similar for FDA and EMA,5 and we expect similar requirements to be included in the upcoming ICH E20.6 To comply, teams need to:demonstrate, through extensive simulations, that they have controlled for type-I error and the chance of erroneous conclusions.show that the methods used can correct for the potential bias introduced by the adaptation and ensure an unbiased treatment-effect estimation.complete a pre-specification of the plan that includes the timing of the interim analysis, and stipulates the SSRE method used (i.e., the promising-zone rule), and test statistics.ensure unplanned changes are not influenced by knowledge of the data, and ensure the homogeneity of effects before and after adaptation.ConclusionSSRE is a relatively new concept, but, thanks to its simplicity, SSRE using the promising zone is one that has grown in popularity in recent years. It comes with a host of benefits: it can increase study power, reduce upfront investment, and has the potential to shorten trial duration, for example. But it is important to note that it is not suited toall situations.Despite its appeal, the promising-zone method, like other SSRE methods, comes with additional logistical and regulatory hurdles, and organizations must consider how each of these relate to their own individual development program. Ultimately, organizations should choose the design that best suits the needs of their study, because there is no panacea in the world of adaptive clinical trials.ReferencesFDA.

              "  'D': 'Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, biotech and emerging biopharma companies were increasingly turning to contract research organizations (CROs) to contain costs and secure therapeutic and clinical trial expertise to help meet their individual objectives. COVID-19 has necessitated the industry further modernize clinical trials. In navigating the pandemicâ€™s impact, growing investments in the sector and the related growing market competition, it can be a â€œmake it or break itâ€\\x9d time for these companies.Biotech clinical trial sponsors often seek a CRO partner for strategic guidance, end-to-end services and solutions, and deep expertise for their pipeline with the ultimate outcome to streamline development processes and timelines to meet ambitious goals. These sponsors may find it beneficial to integrate a CRO partner prior to, or part of, the Investigational New Drug (IND) submission process, setting the foundation for a long-term partnership where a versatile CRO can help them identify the right solutions and services to operationalize trials with efficiency from the start and transition further into the development process.Building the trust factorFor CROs to earn trust, it is important to enter into a partnership without preconceptions. Listening with intention to the sponsorâ€™s needs is key. Start-up biotech companies may not have the in-house resources to draw upon to develop an asset. A good partner listens, guides and asks the right questions to ensure success. A start-upâ€™s leadership team may have exceptional scientific, business or financial backgrounds with limited clinical trial, regulatory or commercialization experience. CROs are willing to collaborate and provide complementary support in every aspect of their clinical journey. As development goals evolve and business priorities change, communication and directional intent for an asset is critical.In some cases, as trust grows, a well-balanced partnership may allow sponsor teams to focus their attention on strategic planning for future development. â€œHaving the IQVIA Biotech project teamâ€™s collective experience to manage a Phase I/II escalation expansion study for our lead immuno-oncology therapy was a huge lift for our team,â€\\x9d said David Bohr, head of clinical operations at Bicara Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech company. â€œWe were able to refocus on our long-term strategy and begin discussions with key thought leaders and advisory boards about what expanded programs may look like based on the teamâ€™s planning and guidance.â€\\x9dLeveraging CRO expertise and solutionsMany sponsors in this sector need a reliable partner to take a potential treatment from the bench to the clinic. A strong CRO-sponsor relationship is highly consultative, where sponsors can lean on a CROâ€™s therapeutic expertise, technology and analytics capabilities, and global reach to overcome barriers to completion. As part of their working relationship, some specific ways biotech sponsors may lean on their CRO are noted below.Early engagement and planningâ€“Before a single patient is enrolled into a trial, sponsors should reach out to their CRO to support the development of a comprehensive clinical development plan to create alignment in strategic direction and ensure the probability of success.For sponsors, integration of a research partner early in the process can help circumvent issues during preclinical and clinical development. Particularly in oncology, a skilled partner can be instrumental in the generation of a comprehensive biomarker strategy together with the ensuing operational execution, including the identification of companion diagnostics. Working in concert with a specialized clinical trial in vitro laboratory can make the process more seamless. A CRO can help by leading discussions on assay validation and regulatory pathways for approval, while keeping feasibility, risks, costs and timelines in mind as well. CROs may also be able to enhance study delivery through predictive or machine-learning approaches and provide direct insight to patient populations and sites of interest to improve trial performance and timelines.â€œFor Bicara, it is important to work with a team that shares the same voice as us,â€\\x9d said Bohr. â€œThis way, the CRO team is readily available to have discussions around patient safety with site investigators or help pre-select target patients based on clinical and biomarker data insights, which improve efforts on companion diagnostics. It would require a lot of in-house resources for us to successfully oversee all those key activities.â€\\x9dTherapeutic and clinical trial expertiseâ€“With exploratory drug development often focused on multiple indications, a CRO with depth of therapeutic expertise can optimize clinical delivery enhancing quality and reducing timelines. Furthermore, years of therapeutic expertise and interaction with investigational sites ensure site engagement with heightened interest and attention to the target patient population. That long-standing base of knowledge regarding delivery challenges within the therapeutic space allows the CRO to prioritize the work needed for the sponsor while knowing what challenges to anticipate.Scalable solutionsâ€“Though a strong CRO partner should have a wide range of end-to-end services to assist biotech companies, capabilities must be scaled to best meet their individual needs.The pandemic is a prime example, opening up a greater degree of patient-centered approaches by sponsors. Through remote monitoring capabilities, telemedicine, digital tools and other decentralized solutions, sponsors and CROs worked together to pivot strategies and maintain trial continuity. Implementing technology-based solutions that fit todayâ€™s needs, and can evolve and meet the sponsorâ€™s future needs, will increase probability of trial success.Bohr notes, â€œDuring the pandemic, we were unsure of how we would continue to collect quality data with overburdened hospitals and no on-site clinical research associates. Working with our CRO partner, the team quickly pivoted to coordinate with site institutions, through their established relationships, to determine needs such as at home study coordinators and telemedicine to continue collecting verified data critical to understanding therapeutic dosage while keeping patient safety top of mind.â€\\x9dStaying agileâ€“Understanding that biotech companies are under tremendous pressure to meet business objectivesâ€”especially one developing a single assetâ€”a CRO that can pivot on strategy and execution can help in this fast-paced environment. CROs should be ready to support delivery of critical milestones, co-development with a pharmaceutical partner, or commercialization.The right partnership between a sponsor and CRO can fuel success through optimized clinical trials. With clear communication and growing trust between both groups, CROs can be an aligned collaborator to provide strategic guidance and help address needs at each milestone on the clinical development pathway, which is critical as the development landscape continues to evolve.Megan Hooton, Chief Operating Officer, IQVIA BiotechDownload Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'D': 'While rebadging is an option that has been around for years, the COVID-19 pandemic spurred more widespread use. As pharmaceutical and biotech companies grappled with the pandemic and needed options to reduce internal headcount while maintaining expertise and business continuity, many turned to the flexibility and value that makes rebadging appealing in both the short and long term.In a nutshell, rebadging is the process by which a client transfers employees and/or contractors off its payroll and onto the payroll of a functional service partnership (FSP) vendor. The client then re-engages those same staff members, who are now employed by the FSP vendor. While rebadging is disruptive, when done well it offers benefits to all parties involved.Clients maintain speed and stability as tried-and-true staff members continue in the same roles as before, without negatively impacting ongoing programs. Rebadging also reduces fixed or direct costs for clients, as well as the legal risks associated with using contractors in full-time, long-term engagements.Employees are assured secure employment, re-assigned back to their original employer (as a vendor contractor) or via new positions within the FSP vendor.Vendors find rebadging not only an important source of revenue, but also gain broader access to top-level talent, critical for any successful service provider.In this article, weâ€™ll take a closer look at the benefits and challenges of rebadging for companies that perform clinical trials and other pharmaceutical/biotech services.ClientsRebadging offers numerous benefits and the risks are manageable, so itâ€™s an effective way for companies to address workforce capacity and labor uncertainty while retaining access to the skilled, experienced personnel on whom they rely. First and foremost, the client maintains continuity across programs. In some cases, rebadging can help to avoid costly severance packages and payouts, as well as the bad press that can be generated for layoffs. It also shows good will to departing employees by helping make the best of an unfortunate scenario.While FSP models with or without rebadging are ultimately about capacity management, the best vendors deliver wide-ranging value to help the client:retain access to a dedicated team of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff for a broad range of services (data management, medical writing, program leadership, clinical supplies, regulatory, clinical monitoring, statistics, medical, etc.).increase flexibility, including on-demand access to time and materials (T&M) or unit-based models that can deliver services with work volume that does not requirededicated FTEs.access additional vendor expert staff from across the globe and shift or centralize services to increase efficiency, reduce timelines and save costs.accelerate and optimize key HR processes, including hiring, onboarding and training.Working with a vendor may offer reduced riskLegislative restrictions around co-employment and contingent workers can increase legal and operational risks when â€œtemporaryâ€\\x9d staff are dedicated to a client in a full-time, long-term capacity. Examples include:assuming risk when there are employment law violationsâ€“companies can be liable for a staff memberâ€™s actions when they area co-employer.inadvertently violating wage and hour laws, which are complex and vary by countryor region.It is important to ensure that co-employment risks are successfully mitigated through a series of contractual and operational designs, and clear delineation between vendor and client responsibilities and oversight for staff.Ideally, contracts define the specific services and obligations of the vendor and client in respect to the staff. For example, as the legal employer of the staff, the vendor should deploy a management layer with the responsibility of providing day-to-day direction to the staff. These managers should also cover the usual line management responsibilities such as career development, performance management, while the overall functional oversight remains with the client.EmployeesFor employees affected by a rebadge, the primary benefit is obvious: their continued employment, surrounded by familiar teammates, systems and project work. Rebadging, when done well, should not result in undue financial burden for the employees. For example, in the EU and elsewhere, ARD-type regulations are in place to help ensure employers donâ€™t take advantage of their employees by offshoring their work or forcing them to rebadge with lower salaries and benefits. The FSP vendor must be expert at navigating these regulations to meet the needs of all parties to ensure each employee is â€œmade whole.â€\\x9dMoreover, joining a successful FSP vendor gives the employees a range of value beyond job security. Over time it allows for easier movement from one client to another via assignment within the vendor, rather than having to quit one client company and take a chance on another.During any organizational transition, is important to keep employees engaged to keep turnover in check, and rebadging can help. Like many other fields, average voluntary turnover rates in the global CRO industry are increasingâ€“from 15.5% in 2019 to 16.3% in 2020 alone.VendorsThe global market for outsourced clinical development services to CROs, including FSP providers, is estimated at approximately US $44.3 billion, and projected to grow to US $57.2 billion by 2024 (CAGR: 6.5%).1 While it is uncertain how much of this comes from rebadged employees, this large market does indicate that the overall appetite for outsourcing is strong.For vendors, one of the major benefits of the rebadging model is that it gives access to proven professionals who are among the clientsâ€™ most valued employees. This in turn helps the vendor understand the clientâ€™s needs and perspective to ultimately serve them better. Transferring qualified employees is also much easier and more economical than the typical recruitment and new hire process.Rebadging is a great way to identify and onboard employees who are highly motivated, self-sufficient, tech-savvy, adaptable and able to learn quickly, make decisions and take action. For FSPs servicing the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, among the functions and key roles that are in high demand are project manager, oversight director, clinical research associate, clinical trial coordinator, medical writer, global clinical supplies manager, biostatistician, medical writer, data manager, safety manager and regulatory expert. For these and many other roles, rebadging is an important means for vendors to identify and retain the top talent that enables them to keep pace with the rigors of clinical development, just as it is an important way for that top talent to remain meaningfully engaged (and steadily employed).FSP implementationRebadging can be an attractive win-win proposition, but the implementation is no simple matter. Companies need to have the following capabilities:Experienceâ€“The knowledge to handle all aspects of each staffing transfer properly and compliantly, including ARD and non-ARD staffing models and global best practices.Dedicated teamâ€“Planning for rebadging, change management and business continuity, which is especially vital when transferring staff. The staff transfer process needs to be handled thoughtfully, with a transition manager coordinating interactions with HR, legal, IT, contracting and the affected employees.Scale and stabilityâ€“Look for an FSP vendor that is growing and has plentiful business aside from your own work, including through the COVID-19 pandemic or other disruptions. This helps assure they can readily absorb your employees and promote a positive outcome for everyone involved, regardless of the ebbs and flows in work volume.Speedâ€“Itâ€™s critical to have a partner to calibrate your capacity and ramp up quickly across any function or service. Service-level agreements are an important step to ensuring FSPs interview, vet and make offers to candidates within a set timeframe. Transfer varies widely, from as little as 10 business days in the United States to three to six months in countries with ARD legislation and works councils or unions.Capturing valueWhile there are numerous reasons why pharmaceutical and biotech companies would want to shift workforce from the traditional headcount to a contract or on-demand model with FSP vendors, clients need to recognize the potential for significant hurdles, including regulatory and legal risks. By navigating the regulatory waters and focusing on maintaining both employee and employer satisfaction, an FSP vendor can help companies engage a steady, agile, full-time workforce while avoiding burgeoning payrolls, direct costs and debtâ€“all while maintaining continuous, high-quality service and speed.Rebadging is just one option an experienced and trusted FSP can offer to help manage significant volatility in work volume. Successful FSP vendors should help calibrate capacity and ramp up quickly across any function and service, including pharmacovigilance, regulatory, biometrics, on-site and remote monitoring, supporting both clinical trials and post-approval marketed products.Reference2020 CRO Market Size Projections: 2019-2024 - COVID 19 Update.

              "  'D': 'During the pandemic, patient engagement (e.g., participation convenience, safety, research relevance, ease of use) has been a guiding principle in the transition to remote and virtual clinical trial support. Given the high level of customization inherent in decentralized and hybrid clinical trial execution models, a growing number of sponsor companies are now looking in earnest to quantify the impact of patient-centric initiatives. Although the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD) and others have dedicated considerable time and attention to gathering objective evidence, until recently, very little has been available.Several years ago, the Drug Information Association (DIA) and Tufts CSDD analyzed 121 distinct case studies to quantify the impact of patient-centric initiatives. In this early study, patient engagement initiatives that offered the highest impact given the investment required were patient advisory boards, professional panels, social media engagement, and patient education programs. These initiatives were relatively simple to implement and inexpensive, yet they reportedly resulted in faster study planning, improvements in recruitment and retention rates, fewer disruptions and delays, and more positive study volunteer feedback. Unfortunately, there was too much variability in definitions, types, and quality of the metrics collected across case examples. As a result, return on patient engagement could notbe generalized.In another study, Tufts CSDDâ€”in collaboration with the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI)â€”developed a method for projecting the financial value of patient engagement using standard risk-adjusted financial modeling techniques. The CTTI-CSDD team assessed the impact of patient engagement on the expected net present value (ENPV) for a typical oncology development program entering Phase II or III clinical trials. For a Phase II project, the cumulative impact of a patient engagement activity (e.g., patient advisory board review) that avoided one protocol amendment and improved enrollment, adherence, and retention was an increase in NPV of $62 million, rising to $65 million by Phase III, and an increase in ENPV of $35 million, increasing to $75 million by Phase III. Depending on the scenario, a $100,000 investment in a patient-centric initiative during the design of the study could produce NPV and ENPV 500 times that amount. This ENPV increase is equivalent to accelerating a pre-Phase II product launch by 30 months or 18 months for a pre-Phase III project.During the past 24 months, Tufts CSDD has undertaken several new studies to gather more objective and practical evidence quantifying the impact of patient engagement. Sponsor focus of late has been particularly high on protocol design given the fundamental role it plays in directing downstream clinical trial activity. Sponsors expect that the ability to incorporate patient preferences and needs during the protocol authoring and finalization period offers a unique and unprecedented opportunity to optimize study design and positively impact clinical trial performance and cost. The results of two CSDD studies underway inform this area.Patient input on draft protocolsPatient advisory boards (PABs) usually entail soliciting feedback from a group of patients and their caregivers (e.g., patient advisory boards or input panels) on the feasibility and convenience of near final protocol designs. PABs are typically moderated meetings among six to 10 people. Although they are not enrolled in clinical trials, participants in an advisory board usually share the burden of disease investigated by the protocol permitting them to speak from direct experience. At this time, an estimated two-thirds of the top 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have implemented one or more PABs to obtain specific protocol design feedback.To assess the impact of PABs, Tufts CSDD has analyzed data from a convenience sample of Phase II and III protocols conducted between 2015 and 2019 across multiple therapeutic areas. Of 153 protocols analyzed, 12 utilized PABs. Given this small sample size and the wide variation in disease conditions represented, these results should be interpreted with caution until a more robust sample has been analyzed.PAB input resulted in simpler protocols and more targeted designs compared to those that did not receive input. PAB-informed protocols had, on average, fewer endpoints, eligibility criteria, and distinct procedures.The number of procedures performed per visit and the total volume of data collected per patient was significantly lower for PAB-informed protocols. Protocols informed by PABs had an average of 15 endpoints and 27 eligibility criteria, 30% and 20% less, respectively, than did protocols that were not informed by PABs. Protocols that used a PAB for design input collected 2.2 million data points, 50% fewer than protocols that did not receive PAB input. And PAB-informed protocols had a lower percentage of procedures supporting tertiary and miscellaneous endpoints.The results also indicated that protocols receiving PAB input had better relative performance and efficiency. Notable differences between protocols informed by PABs and those that were not informed include faster study initiation, shorter clinical trial duration, quicker study close-out, lower-than-planned study budgets, and fewer average number of substantial protocol amendments.The actual cycle times of protocols that did not use PABs typically exceeded planned timelines by between 20% and 90%. Actual cycle times for PAB-informed protocols came in closer to plan (e.g., study initiation cycle time) or beat the plan time lines by 6% to 17%. And actual PAB-informed protocol budgets came in 28% below planned budgets. Protocols that did not use a PAB tended to have actual budgets 3% above plan. Protocols that used a PAB had on average one fewer substantial amendment than those that did not.Designs informed by participation burdenThe use of a patient burden assessment score or algorithm has been gaining momentum as valuable input into early-stage protocol authoring. A tool developed by the National Institute of Health several years ago measured patient attitudes and correlated them with patient self-report of the likelihood to participate in, and the intent to drop out of, a clinical trial.Dassault Systems and IQVIA have been developing and beginning to pilot-test patient burden assessment tools (e.g., the Patient Burden Index and the Patient Friction Coefficient, respectively) among pharmaceutical companies.In 2019, Tufts CSDDâ€”in collaboration with ZS, a global management consulting firm, developed and tested an initial participant burden algorithm against pharmaceutical and biotechnology company protocols based on the perceptions and preferences of 591 patients living with one of five disease conditions in the US.During the past 14 months, weâ€™ve compiled overall and clinical trial-specific preferences and perceptions from 3,002 global patients across 39 disease conditions to derive and test a revised algorithm against a convenience sample of 266 recently completed protocols. This algorithm takes an expansive look at participation burden and includes protocol procedures, clinical trial logistics and convenience, disease burden, medication adherence, mobility, lifestyle restrictions, and caregiver reliance.The revised participation burden algorithm is highly associated with, and predictive of, many clinical trial performance outcomes. Mean participant burden scores were highly correlated with, and predictive of, screen failure rates. This result is consistent with past qualitative studies that have demonstrated the impact of perceived burden on reducing patient willingness to enroll in clinical trials.Mean participant burden scores were also positively correlated and predictive of treatment duration and overall clinical trial duration. These two cycle time measures are in part a function of the long-term effects of protocol demands on participant retention.Burden scores were not predictive of study start-up (approval to FPFV) or study close-out (LPLV to database lock) durations. These latter two cycle times are less dependent on study participant experience and more dependent on clinical research professional preparedness, coordination, and efficiency.We were disappointed to find that our enhanced participant burden score was not associated with, or predictive of, clinical trial drop-out rates. We used a broad definition of â€œdrop-out ratesâ€\\x9d in the study that included all factors other than volunteer mortality. For this reason, drop-out rates were a function of far more than the volunteerâ€™s decision to prematurely terminate participation. Drop-out rates included administrative factors; lack of efficacy and insufficient therapeutic response; drug safety issues and adverse events; study-specific withdrawal considerations (e.g., pre-defined discontinuation considerations and volunteers no longer meeting the study requirements); and poor compliance and protocol non-adherence.In future applications and assessments of the participation burden algorithm, we plan to focus on drop-outs specifically associated with protocol demands and inconveniences resulting in premature termination of participation. New research is underway to apply the participant burden algorithm prospectively in protocol design. Ten pharmaceutical companies are working with Tufts CSDD and ZS to benchmark mean participant burden scores across protocols in their portfolio. Retrospective company participant burden benchmarks will be used to guide prospective protocol authoring.In closingThe insights from these recent studies and ongoing research are intended to assist drug development teams and protocol authors in leveraging patient voices to retrospectively understand clinical trial performance outcomes and to prospectively inform protocol design decisions.Looking beyond protocol design, Tufts CSDD and the DIA are also embarking on a new working group study in the fall of 2021 to gather robust, objective, and practical data linking organization-specific patient engagement initiativesâ€”pre-, during and post-participationâ€”to clinical trial and program-level performance and quality outcomes. We encourage sponsor organizations to participate.Reach Ken Getz via email at kenneth.getz@tufts.eduDownload Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'C': 'Elizabeth Rickenbacher, PhD, Director of Strategy for 4G Clinical discusses changes in the IRT and RTSM solutions.',\n",
              "  'D': 'Elizabeth Rickenbacher, PhD, Director of Strategy for 4G Clinical, has over 15 years of experience in the field of life sciences, and is an eClinical RTSM solutions subject matter expert. In this Q&A, she discusses changes in the IRT and RTSM solutions, their impact on trials during COVID, and the future need for these systems.Applied Clinical Trials: RTSM (Randomization and Trial Supply Management) can be considered an evolution of traditional IRT (Interactive Response Technology). Is the distinction important?Elizabeth Rickenbacher: Historically, IRT was used primarily for randomization and getting drugs to the site. Over the years, it became apparent that supply management was just as critical as randomization and the combined action of them together elevates the function of this system. They are synergistic and need to coexist. It also helps to bridge the silos between clinical and supply organizations.The term RTSM has been around since the advent of IRT technologies, but it refers more to the function of the actual system vs. the modality of delivery (voice, web, mobile, etc).In that way, RTSM is an evolution of traditional IRT as it more accurately reflects the functions of the technology, and recognizes the importance of the interaction between clinical operations and supply.ACT: What can we expect of advancements in RTSMs in the next five years?Rickenbacher: RTSM must continue to evolve to enable new clinical trial designs. Given what we see now, we can expect advancements in RTSMs to handle future iterations of decentralized trial designs, cell and gene therapy trials, digital supply chains as well as much more complexity in terms of adaptive designs, particularly in oncology trials.From a technical and process point of view, there is a trend toward more self-service components to ease the administrative burden of adapting study parameters such as managing cohorts; enhanced flexibility to the patient level as patient advocacy for their own care continues to increase; as well as functionality to support the protocol designs of tomorrowâ€™s trials.ACT: How has the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a renewed need for RTSMsand IRTs?Rickenbacher: RTSMs are a necessary technology for clinical trials which are too complex for manual trial management. COVID-19 has not changed that. Rather than catalyzing a renewed need for RTSMs, the pandemic has driven innovation in its functionality, for example, the ability to turn direct-to-patient capabilities on and off as needed within a live trial and enable decentralized trial designs with flexibility for patient choice.RTSMs that have integrated forecasting capabilities also have helped navigate clinical supply challenges. While clinical supply chains were not disrupted as much as originally feared, agility in the supply chain became a necessity during the pandemic and will continue to be the case moving forward.ACT: What future clinical trial trends will increase the need for RTSM?Rickenbacher: While most Phase I trials are healthy volunteer studies that rarely need the support of an RTSM system, RTSMs are being used more frequently in Phase Ib oncology studies in patients. They have adaptive designs to allow the sponsor to follow different avenues of researchâ€“different dose levels, different dosing frequencies, different combination therapies, etc. These more intricate protocol designs and additional data and requirements are expected to move to the next phase.Ultimately, these trials nearly equate to the completion of multiple early phase trials within a single trial. This complex management requires modern RTSM systems for the flexibility to adapt as these trials evolve.Another example is handling program level supply management, such as ISTs (Investigator Sponsored Trials). The ability to handle these types of trials in an efficient and cost-effective manner has now become possible.As for future clinical trial trends, as mentioned before, decentralized trials and increased cell and gene therapy trials, as well as anything that is trending towards therapies for personalized medicine, will require very sophisticated RTSMs to support the multi-faceted logistical requirements of manufacturing and complex supply chains, as well as resource planning and allocation.Download Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'C': 'Slovenia brings EU health officials together for increased emphasis on repurposing.',\n",
              "  'D': 'Repurposing of medicines is back on the EU agenda, with the COVID-19 pandemic providing a boost to the long-running arguments for identifying new uses for approved or investigational products outside the scope of their original medical indication. The issue was given new prominence during the summer by Slovenia, the country holding the presidency of the EU health council until the end of 2021. The Slovenian health minister brought together regulators and health officials from across Europe for something of a premiÃ¨re in terms of EU discussions on the topic. And it supported the play with a lengthy reflection paper developed in concert with the World Health Organization, ambitiously entitled â€˜Repurposing of medicines in oncologyâ€“the underrated champion of sustainable innovation.â€™ The aim was to give sharper focus and new impetus for a more general discussion of repurposing that has been underway among EU health officials for several years now, without reaching any clear conclusions.The Slovenian starting point is that new technology and new approaches can revolutionize what has been seen traditionally as a predominantly non-commercial and even artisanal approach to drug development. It stresses in its background paper that repurposing previously has moved on from its earlier reliance on an ad hoc discovery process, and can now build on organized, systematic, data-driven approaches to identify suitable candidates, facilitated by the use of big data and artificial intelligence. The focus is on cancer, but the overall argument is that repurposing can deliver innovation in terms of new treatments that resolve unaddressed health needs, and often in shorter timeframes than de novo development.This chimes conveniently with the EU push during 2021 for repurposing of treatments specifically to counter COVID-19, and also gains strength from the widely-publicized success of the RECOVERY trial in identifying valuable therapeutics for COVID-19 patientsâ€“notably dexamethasone. As the paper says, â€œThe lack of effective therapies for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen highlighted the need to find treatments that can be applied quickly to reduce mortality and morbidity. Repurposing was identified as one main strategy to provide a fast and cost-efficient approach to this purpose.â€\\x9dBut the argument relies too, on more familiar argumentsâ€“that repurposing can offer lower costs of development and lower risk of failureâ€“as well as pointing out that many products are already commonly used off-label in cancer treatment, particularly for patients who have no alternative options. â€œEstablishing rigorous scientific evidence and repurposing the vast arsenal of existing approved medicines with established safety profiles may be an attractive strategy to offer more effective treatment options to patients with cancer,â€\\x9d says Slovenia.The paper also assembles a range of specific points in defense of its thesis, collectively amounting to an appeal for a radical review of the current business and regulatory models of drug development. Most of the arguments are linked to easing conditions for the non-commercial activity that still constitutes much of the repurposing of off-patent medicines, particularly for cancer treatment. Slovenia sees potential for addressing areas that are not attractive for the pharmaceutical industry, such as rare cancers (which it estimates as accounting for a fifth of new cases in Europe). It depicts â€œtraditional models of collecting clinical evidenceâ€\\x9d as sub-optimal for repurposing, â€œowing to the high costs involved and the applicability of established pharmaceutical development and testing paradigms,â€\\x9d notably for combination therapies.The paper perceives particular handicaps in the persistent reliance on the good will of industrial partners. As it observes, only the marketing authorization holder of a given medicine can currently apply for an extension or variation of its marketing authorization. Consequently, even if non-commercial clinical trials confirm the efficacy of a repurposed drug, patient access to these treatments depends on the willingness of a pharmaceutical company to obtain authorization for the new indication and to take responsibility for its risk managementâ€“something that experience to date shows has not often been forthcoming. â€œReturns on investment for repurposed off-patent medicines are expected to be low or nil, and pharmaceutical developers are rarely interested in pursuing repurposing opportunities, even when clinical evidence is made readily available by other stakeholders,â€\\x9d it remarks glumly. In addition, the existing EU legislation that might help in promoting off-patent drug repurposing (such as on data exclusivity or orphan designation) â€œdo not offer the usual level of incentives for the industry compared to alternative investments, and they are underused.â€\\x9dThe paper also reflects a keen awareness of the current debates in the EUâ€“and elsewhereâ€“over the cost of medicines, liberally citing references from official international organizations to the â€œexorbitantâ€\\x9d price of cancer medicines or â€œmarket failureâ€\\x9d endangering patientsâ€™ access through â€œvery high and unsustainable price levels.â€\\x9dIn the best tradition of European problem statements, the Slovenian initiative also contains a range of potential solutions, particularly aimed at assisting non-commercial repurposing. They are rather glibly listed as â€œreducing the risk of failure by improving the selection of candidates, facilitating generation of clinical evidence, streamlining regulated processes, amending restrictive legislation, improving collaboration and coordination between stakeholders and ensuring adequate funding.â€\\x9d Unexceptionable ambitionsâ€“but requiring rather more than enunciation to realize them.Wide support can be assumed for the proposals for early scientific advice and regulatory assistance throughout the process to ease the generation of evidence, and â€œexploring the potential for greater reliance on real-world data, data networks, adaptive platform trials and innovative trial designsâ€\\x9d finds an echo in much current EU debate. The concept of reducing fees for repurposing of financially unattractive medicines can be seen as consonant with the current approach of easing regulatory barriers for smaller firms or orphan products. But simply citing â€œartificial intelligence and use of big dataâ€\\x9d may be considered a little thin as a way of improving selection of candidates. And most strikingly, perhaps, many in industry will bristle at the suggestion of over-riding current rules that permit marketing authorization holders as sole arbiters of applications for authorization of new indications for their products. This proposal is not, many will say, the solution to â€œremoving barriers for non-commercial champions.â€\\x9dDownload Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'C': 'A move back to in-house management of clinops could be on the horizon for sponsors.',\n",
              "  'D': 'In this monthâ€™s main feature, â€œThe Post-Pandemic CRO Landscape,â€\\x9d our contributor casually introduced this possibility. Could advances in technology across the clinical trials board correlate to a decreased use of CROs and a move to bring clinical trials operations back in-house to the sponsor?Prior to the pandemic, I traveled to numerous conferences where sponsor speakers shared experiences of bringing their trials back in-house. Usually they were on a smaller scaleâ€“a pilot of sortsâ€“but still interesting. In an interview for the main feature, Peter Benton, President and Co-CEO of Worldwide Clinical Trials, noted: â€œIn some cases, larger sponsors are taking their CRO services in house, bringing on their own tech stack, labs, and employees. It will be interesting to see how this strategy will serve them over the long term.â€\\x9dFor as long as CROs have been around, technology has been a competitive differentiator. Consider Parexelâ€™s early (2005) purchase of Perceptive Informatics. The CRO wanted to capitalize on the technology firmâ€™s portfolio including cutting-edge clinical solutions at the timeâ€”web-based portal solutions, tracking tools, IVRS, CTMS, electronic diary and investigator database solutions, as well as medical diagnostics services.In this issue, three CROs discuss their use of Veeva Systemsâ€™ solutions to increase their capabilities for agile study design and artificial intelligence to execute trials for their clients.Similarly, Oracle reports in the main feature more CROs looking to the company to design agile systems to address their clientsâ€™ needs.Sponsors, too, could take advantage of the plethora of agile solutions, but is that a reality? Benton believes that clinical trials are a quintessentially human endeavor, and technology a tool. â€œThe human touch will always be needed in clinical trials, and CROs will still have an important role to play in providing strategic guidance, analysis, confirmationâ€”all things that technology can support but cannot entirely replace. CROs that embrace the new technology and innovation will lead the industry rather than being left to fear the outcomes of change.â€\\x9dWith almost 80% of clinical trials in the hands of a CRO, it would be a revolution of sorts if all went back in-house. Benton points to the sponsorsâ€™ ultimate responsibility for regulatory risk of bringing new pharmaceutical offerings to market. â€œBringing the CRO activities in-house, however, means that the organization isnâ€™t just responsible for the regulatory outcomes, they would newly assume the operational risks as well.â€\\x9d A point well taken.Lisa HendersonÂ\\xa0isÂ\\xa0Editor-in-Chief ofÂ\\xa0Applied Clinical Trials.Â\\xa0She can be reached atÂ\\xa0lhenderson@mjhlifesciences.com.Download Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-09-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'C': 'A report from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzes how drug pricing policies could reduce the number of new therapies coming to market.',\n",
              "  'D': 'Legislative proposals for curbing outlays on prescription drugs have moved to center stage, as Congress looks hard for ways to pay for costly initiatives to repair the nationâ€™s infrastructure, offset global warming and expand health care programs. These developments have focused attention on a recent report from the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzing how drug pricing policies could reduce the number of new therapies coming to market. Industry has long warned of such an outcome and has ramped up efforts to preserve U.S. market support for global biopharma R&D.The CBO report explains why companies investing in new drug development may drop long and costly research in some medicines if Congress approves legislation that permits Medicare to limit reimbursement for certain leading drugs. The main bill in question, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (HR 3), would give the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authority to negotiate drug prices on a certain number of high-use medicines in Medicare drug plans based on an international index of prices at several other countries. Manufacturers that fail to agree to the set prices for Part D coverage would face stiff penalties. While such a policy is estimated to save the government some $900 billion, CBO calculates that it would reduce the number of new drugs coming to market by two new therapies in the first decade, adding up to possibly 60 fewer drugs over 30 years.Â\\xa0The analysts explain that potential changes in company profits and in drug development costs are main factors influencing how many new drug candidates enter clinical trials at different stages. A 15 to 25% drop in expected returns on higher-cost drugs could reduce new drug approvals by 0.5% a year, an amount that would accumulate over time. Thus, the simulation model calculates that the proposed curb on future market prices will lead biopharma companies to abandon the development of drug candidates with less certain returns on investment, particularly in phase I and phase II clinical development. Those less profitable therapies, as for rare conditions or infectious diseases, may be first on the chopping block, as opposed to new medicines that address clear needs for large patient cohorts.The larger issue for policy makers is whether such a decline in new drug development would have a serious impact on patients and health outcomes, something that here CBO does not address. Market approval of more widely used new treatments for heart disease or common cancers may actually lead to lower prices in the market, which could have wider public benefits. Or, price limits for innovative therapies with potential for large sales and profits could have a serious effect on investment in newer, smaller biotech companies. BioCentury editor Steve Usdin explains that the CBO analysis fails to recognize the broader impact of price controls on the ability of new, highly innovative firms to gain financial support, as such developments would reduce interest among venture capital investors in the biotech market and in portfolios of investigational programs. Other commentaries recognize the complexities of drug pricing proposals, as seen a recent report on the impact of enacting HR 3 by Paul Ginsburg and Steven Lieberman, issued by the Brookings/USC Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. It outlines a broad range of impacts from legislation authorizing government controls on what manufacturers can charge for their drugs, noting that effects would vary, depending on the process used to set prices, what penalties fall on those firms that donâ€™t comply, what types of drugs are affected, the prevalence of competitor products, whether payers could negotiate lower prices, if pricing curbs apply only to Medicare or to all U.S. patients, and how such a program would go about setting the price.Manufacturers, meanwhile, continue to raise concerns about the potential harm on the prescription drug market from such proposed pricing policies. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) predicts that halting development of even only a few new therapies could have serious consequences for people living with rare diseases and for patients needing new antibiotics or antivirals to treat future life-threatening illnesses. BIO and its members also are examining the impact of price controls in states with active biopharmaceutical R&D operations, as seen in a recent â€œGood Day BIOâ€\\x9d posting. The Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and its members have ramped up lobbying on these issues, emphasizing that a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare patients is a preferable for reducing consumer health care costs than price controls.Another response to concerns about reduced new drug development is to offset any drop in industry R&D with increased government support for the National Institutes of Health perhaps using some of the savings from proposed legislation for this purpose. And while the public generally supports drug price controls, especially if linked to reduced outlays on specific medicines, that enthusiasm wanes notably when seen to reduce R&D for new treatments, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation Health tracking poll.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'A regulatory submission marks the end of a long, exciting, and often challenging journey. Itâ€™s the final and most pivotal step in clinical development which, if not done correctly, can be a barrier to bringing your valuable product to market. For smaller companies in particular, submission can be a make-or-break situation.Itâ€™s especially true, at this time, when clinical development has never been more complex. Industry guidance is changing for many therapeutic areas and COVID-19 has accelerated the evolution in trial design, giving rise to innovative approaches such as digital, decentralized, and virtual trials. Additionally, there are more data sources than ever before, which demand expert integration prior to submission.The more things change, however, the more they stay the same. The key to submission success continues to be delivering a clear and effective integrated summary of safety (ISS) and efficacy (ISE) as quickly as possible. This requires a multidisciplinary team of expertsâ€”clinical, statistical, regulatory, medical writing and moreâ€”who understand the compound and regulatory requirements and can do the hard work of generating and integrating the data to address all safety and efficacy questions.Plans are never set in stoneItâ€™s important to start with the end in mind, though the inherent nature of clinical development is fluid. In many cases the data, not the plan, provide the direction. Teams wonâ€™t really know what theyâ€™re facing until they see: first, the data from individual studies; and second, those data in an integrated fashion. As is standard practice in the clinical trials industry, multiple rigorous studies are required to prove the safety and efficacy of a treatment:Phase I: First-in-human studies in healthy volunteers to determine if a treatment is safe, determine how it works and understand any side effectsPhase II: Studies in patients with the disease/condition to see if the treatment is effective and to understand the optimal dose/administrationPhase III: Large randomized studies of patients that take place across regions or countries to understand how the treatment compares to any existing treatmentsAn expert data integration strategy is critical because many forks in the road can and will arise. Product acquisitions are commonplace after a successful Phase II, impacting both plans and data as the scope inevitably changes. Additionally, there may be early-stage trials that are not beneficial to the overall program, so itâ€™s important to be able to consider that data in context and weed it out during data pooling.A question of timingTimelines shown are typical but may be compressed in cases such as emergency use authorization or fast track, breakthrough, or other accelerated designations.Phase III is a critical milestone where positive results mean the product will likely move forward with a submission. Waiting until the end of Phase III to create your data integration strategy is not a feasible option because doing so risks adding months to the process and delaying regulatory approval.Having the ISS and ISE ready soon after the last Phase III pivotal study database lock can expedite the submission and help speed the new medication to the market. This means that ISS and ISE activities must happen in parallel to the individual pivotal study analysis.Starting ISS/ISE activities once Phase III pivotal study results are complete can streamline the integrated reporting process, which can reduce effort and costs. But this approach does extend the submission timeline.Timing is a perennial challenge. Plan too early and you may waste time, money, and resources if initial study results are not optimal. Plan too late, and you lengthen the time it takes to get your product to market.The data charts your courseThe accepted industry guidance for study data submission is Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, or CDISC. These standards determine the format data must be submitted in, for both individual studies and integrated reporting. Although CDISC is used industrywide, there are different interpretations by company and region. The process will mean submitting to one region and then using that information to amend and submit, region by region.Adherence to the data standards/guidance is critical to helping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other agency reviewers review and understand the data. If the data are not in the correct format, the submission will be rejected and will need to be configured and submitted againâ€”costing valuable time, money, and loss of sales revenue.Good data integration means converting and consolidating data from different studies on multiple systems in different formats. This is not as easy as it sounds because it requires resources who know every study, every format, every endpoint, and the full development process. Regulators around the world will want the data in the standard format for quick interpretation and answers to their questions. This takes specialized knowledge.Resource across the processThe compound development plan drives the overarching resourcing approach. Itâ€™s a delicate dance, being able to estimate what specific resourcing will be required for a successful submission: how many people, what specific experience level, when?Key rolesThere are certain roles to cover through the clinical development journey. We will not discuss what is required for individual studies but for integration it is important that a submission-experienced programming leader is in place. This person can set the programming strategy that will be deployed alongside the integration lead statistician.Â\\xa0Involving the medical writer preparing the integrated reports and an experienced regulatory lead early also is essential.Â\\xa0They along with the statistician and programmer will help drive the appropriate strategy.Other key players to involve are medical experts who will help define pooling approaches that are applicable given the available data and medical need/practice plus other experts depending on the need (e.g., pharmacokinetics, data managers for recoding activities).For data integration and statistical programming, youâ€™ll need people who know what data can go together and are familiar with how to post and interact with regulators. This includes knowledge of platforms and folder structures to keep everything ticked off and in order.Key skills across the journeyOnce the integration strategy is set and ISS/ISE timelines are determined, a team with the right experience level and the right size becomes key to a successful submission.Those who take on the challenges of an ISS/ISE must possess compound knowledge, therapeutic experience, and statistical and programming technical expertise, but also have a deep understanding of regulatory requirements and know how these vary from country to country.Throughout the ISS/ISE production periodâ€”especially when it is happening in parallel with individual study reporting effortâ€”there will be times when rapid resourcing ramp up becomes necessary to accommodate new or changing analysis requirements across the program. How can the team effectively deal with the peaks and troughs of the resourcing needs to avoid unnecessary delay of the overall submission timelines?Once the submission goes out the door, you must plan for the period between the filing and regulatory approval. Some regulatory agencies may require rapid responses to review questions throughout the review period. There also will be 120-day updates. These additional requirements must be resourced by members of the core team to ensure efficiency and speed in responses.There is no one answer to these questions; rather, various scenarios should be worked through with the submission team to determine the best course of action.Expertise is everythingStatistical/data integration expertise is your primary concern at this stage (as opposed to data management, which occurs during the clinical trial process itselfâ€”the exception being to update coding terms to the same versions of dictionaries before integration). Even so, there are many other factors that drive the need for having other skilled experts on the team.The submission strategy for every therapeutic area, indication and region is fully uniqueâ€”a cardiology study is vastly different from oncology.If youâ€™re working in rare diseases, there will be a small population and pool of data. Do you have a partner who understands this and has proven success in this area?There are always follow-ups and updates from regulators! Submission isnâ€™t the end of the road, so resource accordingly.Experience and relationships with regulators around the world often go hand in hand. Proactive engagement with agencies is a success factor because there are many open channels to engage with regulators in advance. For instance, you can share your preliminary plan, give them early looks at the data and let them point out any potential red flags or concerns. Take advantage of that so you can see questions coming, make any course corrections and plan for a positive response.Above all, getting to yes with regulatory agencies involves a deep knowledge of the mechanics of the submission as well as how to interact with regulators.

              "  'D': 'Amidst a very busy time for the agency, FDA formally unveiled its plan for revising and renewing its fee program for drugs and biologics, with an eye to gaining Congressional approval early next year. The program announced August 23, 2021, is set to collect more than $1 billion in annual fees to support additional staffers and multiple initiatives in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The aim is to build on the current fee program, so that Congress will reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VII) in time for it to be operational by October 1, 2022.The specifics for PDUFA VII, which will run from FY 2023 through 2027, are spelled out in the new Commitment Letter negotiated this past year by FDA and industry leaders. This lengthy description of proposals and policies will be further discussed at a virtual FDA public meeting at the end of September. The aim is to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to learn more about program changes and to weigh in on proposed enhancements, in comments due October 28, 2021.Along with specifying the fees industry will pay for FY 2023 through 2027 and relevant changes to timeframes for CDER and CBER to review and approve applications for new drugs and biologics, the 71-page PDUFA VII letter describes many new and expanded initiatives for enhancing oversight of certain therapies and for improving regulatory practices. There are additional pilot programs, timeframes for issuing new guidances, and an expanded range of FDA-sponsor meetings to smooth the path to approval for new therapies. A specific change extends the fee program to allergenic extract products under a one-year phase-in process at CBER. Oversight of combination products would be enhanced by policies governing human factor validation study protocols. The plan also outlines improvements in the process for assessing REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) and enhancements for hiring and retaining staffers in CDER and CBER.Rare diseases & gene therapiesTo support the development of new treatments for rare diseases, FDA proposes a Split Real Time Application Review (STAR) pilot program to streamline the review process for new rare disease endpoints by allowing sponsors to split an efficacy supplement into two components. CDER and CBER also would provide faster staff input on certain novel issues raised during development through two new types of meetings with sponsors.PDUFA VII also aims to enhance CBER oversight of cell and gene therapies (CGT) by expanding staff and resources for its Office of Tissues & Advanced Therapies (OTAT). One goal is to increase opportunities for manufacturers to gain added FDA feedback on these complex products. CBER also would issue guidance on clinical trial design for CGTs, on capturing post-approval safety and efficacy data, and on information needed in post-approval studies for Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies (RMATs).Advancing productionAnother strategy for avoiding delays in the development and approval of innovative products aims to enhance the review of drug manufacturing quality and to advance innovative manufacturing technologies. The user fee program would expedite the development of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data for products likely to provide notable patient benefit, with a focus on science and risk-based approaches through a CMC Development & Readiness Pilot to accelerate assessment of manufacturing data for relevant complex products. Related to this, FDA will hold a public workshop to discuss best practices, barriers, and overall strategies for advancing innovative manufacturing.FDA also aims to limit development delays related to manufacturing operations by reviewing and updating tools for inspecting biopharma facilities. Building on the increased use of alternative oversight approaches adopted during the pandemic, FDA will issue new guidance on the use of additional facility assessment tools, including plant records and reports from other regulatory authorities.An important PDUFA initiative will support broader use of real-world evidence (RWE), particularly to meet post-approval study requirements. One new pilot will provide early advice on the acceptability of such data in added labeling claims and indications for approved products. Another is to advance the use of RWE by seeking agreement on what data, study designs and regulatory approaches can generate RWE that will support regulatory decisions. FDA and sponsors will work to address post-marketing required studies (PMRs) earlier in the pre-market setting and to establish processes for manufacturers to be released from PMR requirements deemed no longer necessary.Related to this is added user fee support for incorporating more RWE into FDAâ€™s Sentinel System to enhance post-market monitoring. Similarly, FDA seeks to advance its use of digital health technologies (DHTs) in drug development and review, building on broader agency plans for leveraging cloud technologies and related approaches through its Technology & Data Modernization Action Plan. CBER, in particular, will move to replace its older IT system as part of FDAâ€™s IT modernization initiative.Pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers strongly support and are willing to pay considerable sums to fund the numerous demonstration projects, policy updates and added meetings designed to further speed new medicines to patients. The PDUFA â€œgoal datesâ€\\x9d for FDA to approve a pending NDA or BLA are carefully watched by all concerned players for indications that a new therapy is moving forward as expected or may run into delays.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'As we enter a post-pandemic era, many of us still contemplate what weâ€™ve been through, and how to move forward. The pandemic shifted the way we operate clinical trials, but now that the world is entering a new normal, what will clinical trials look like? In this interview, Terrence Rooney, VP of Clinical Development at Janssen, will take us through a journey of how Janssen changed during the pandemic, and what the future will hold.Moe Alsumidaie: How did the pandemic impact clinical trials for Janssen immunology?Terrence Rooney: As the pandemic broke in March, we assembled an Immunology COVID-19 Operations Task Force, with representation from early and late phase clinical development, medical safety, medical affairs, clinical operations, regulatory, Quality, quantitative sciences (biostats), project management, and other functions. This group drove and coordinated our approach to our R&D clinical trial activities in the context of the pandemic crisis.The three biggest challenges that the pandemic created for our clinical trials were in the areas of: patient safety and wellbeing, study integrity, and study recruitment.Â\\xa0To ensure patient safety and wellbeing we created processes to stay abreast of everchanging local safety and quarantine guidance and to adjust to protect patient wellbeing first and foremost. As for study integrity, we recognized that the systems and processes for data capture, correction, maintenance, transmission, and retention could be impacted by the pandemic and required that we be nimble with regard to adjustments or postponement. Finally, the pandemic hindered recruitment for our clinical trials impacting both patient and staff participation. In the interim, we developed supportive content and activated online communication mechanisms to stay in close communication with our patients, study sites, administrators, and sponsors to manage questions and concerns remotely as well as support data collection.MA: When the pandemic hit, what did Janssen do to stay its course and continue to advance its studies?Â\\xa0TR: As a priority, the COVID-19 Operations Task Force established foundational guiding principles and communicated them to study teams and investigative site partnersâ€”these principles included following up-to-date guidance about the pandemic from local/regional authorities, following approved study protocols, keeping communications open between Janssen and investigators and their staffs, and specifying that final decisions for individual patient care were at the discretion of investigators, based on their medical judgment.Â\\xa0These principles seem apparent, but it was helpful to put them in writing and share them and emphasize that they were developed with patient safety and wellbeing in mind.MA: Were there any special adjustments to protocols? Study sites? Patient tracking? Patient visits?TR: Janssen developed and deployed means to track the pandemicâ€™s impact on our studies. We looked at factors such as the instances of COVID infection reported in study subjects and the operational implications of pandemic disruptions on study conduct â€“ including enrollment and post-enrollment study activities such as dosing and patient visits/data acquisition.MA: How was patient recruitment impacted?TR: With pandemic tracking information, we tailored our approach to our trialsâ€”including pausing vs. permitting screening and enrollment based on our evolving assessment of the pandemicâ€™s epidemiology, its impact on our study patients, conduct, and data, as well as what was happening across the industry. Our trials are global, allowing us to adjust trial locations and practices, depending on what was happening in one country or region.MA: Did Janssen implement any new digital technologies that it may not have used before for monitoring, sampling, communication? What were they? How did it go?TR: Our COVID-19 Operations Task Force steered adaptations in the conduct of our studies to prioritize patient wellbeing and study integrity while maintaining compliance with regulatory/GCP/other applicable standards. Transformations in clinical trial conduct included remote visits, direct-to-patient provision of study drugs, and exclusion of subjects with recent COVID infection from study enrollment. In terms of communication among the team, we relied on intranet sites, regular meetings with Zoom, and other methods to keep our staff connected to internal and external guidance and additional news flow relevant to trial conduct.Across Janssen Research and Development we developed and deployed an interactive platform that integrated public data sources on COVID infection (and then vaccination) rates by geography, overlaying our trial sites and including forecasting algorithms. Detailed feedback from our local sources provided texture as to local logistical conditions providing key information regarding the virus, patient, and staff challenges. This allowed us to adapt our global resources appropriately as COVID waxed and waned by region.MA: Is Janssen doing anything to move to a model of decentralized clinical trials? Or are there any new remote processes or technologies implemented during the pandemic that you found valuable and may continue using post-pandemic?TR: As a general direction and where it makes sense, yes. We have had to adapt many ways of working to deal with the demands of the pandemic and are certainly looking to retain the best and most valuable of these innovations in our practices in the future. Offering greater flexibility in how we bring our clinical trials to patients is undoubtedly one of these themes.Two major innovations in our clinical trial practices will stay post-pandemic: data science approaches to trial recruitment and technologies that enable remote trial conduct. They match trials to the right sites and patients and make those trials attractive and flexible to participate in. We will retain and develop these innovations to help speed our potential medicines to patients, to stay competitive, and to be prepared for future crises like the present one.Moe Alsumidaie, MBA, MSF, is a thought leader and expert in the application of business analytics toward clinical trials, and Editorial Advisory Board member for and regular contributor to Applied Clinical Trials.'},\n",

              "  'B': 'Cloud-Based Metadata Repositories: The Answer to Streamlined Clinical Trials',\n",
              "  'C': 'How the latest cloud-based CMDRs can be used to help trial managers set trials up quicker, observe early results, and ensure that metadata is available in a format that meets regulatory standards.',\n",
              "  'D': 'This article explores how the latest all-in-one, cloud-based clinical metadata repositories (CMDRs) and study automation platforms can be used to help clinical managers set trials up quicker, observe early results and ensure that metadata is available in a format that meets regulatory standards.Accelerating safe and effective clinical trials starts with metadataâ€”the building blocks that define the trial and ensure standardized and compliant data collection. By reusing approved metadata, trial managers can quickly design trials that are optimized to deliver regulatory-submissible data. This means that trials can start faster and, when less data rework is needed, early insights can be gained, facilitating flexible processes and improving safety.Clinical trial metadata management systems are often evolved from an integration of processes, workflows and repositories, and are added to as businesses grow or merge. Disparate legacy systems can cause team members to operate in siloes, and as new systems and technology are onboarded, integration can be difficult, requiring manual workarounds. Just finding the required datasets can be challenging as they can be stored in many different formats and files, as well as on separate servers.Â\\xa0As organizations worked to digitize studies and make use of electronic data capture (EDC) systems and electronic case report forms (eCRFs), many introduced processes with multiple manual steps. In the modern clinical trial, this may translate into several manual builds in different EDCs, each time-consuming, and at risk of errors that can result in hours of rework.Then, there is the matter of compliance. When metadata files are held disparately, it can be hard to create a single-source-of-truth and ensure that the resulting clinical trial data outputs meet the requirements set by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC).1 Non-compliant data outputs run the risk of rejection by regulatory bodies or requiring rework, a task that adds considerable time at the end of a lengthy trial.Since new versions of CDISC standards are released frequently, and CDISC Controlled Terminology is updated quarterly, keeping abreast of new developments is critical. To do so, organizations may need dedicated internal experts or external assistance to monitor the regulatory environment and implement any necessary updates to metadata management systems. When these revisions coincide with other organizational and clinical trial protocol adjustments, change control becomes a risk. Any amendment to metadata management systems will have an impact on other assets, data outputs and future study builds. And when the impact of these system changes cannot be anticipated, it can be difficult to make an informed and educated decision about how and when these updates should take place. Approval procedures can reduce this risk but, when email chains are involved, this can waste valuable time.It can be tempting to bring more technology in to help deal with each individual issue, but often this can add to the problem, causing greater integration issues and perpetuating the silo mentality.A positive view on standardizationTo address some of the issues raised by pharmaceutical organizations and regulatory bodies around the regulatory review process, CDISC was established to help standardize data submitted for approvals. Standards were established not just for data tabulation and analysis by regulatory bodies, but also for the planning and data collection elements that are completed internally. This interoperability between the planning, build and outputs of the clinical trial process aims to expedite the regulatory review process, while also helping reduce the amount of time and effort that all stakeholders spend making sense of unstandardized data.CDISC standards are now required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PDMA), as well as being the preferred standard for electronic data submission to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China.2Figure 1: CDISC standards model.Source: FormedixAlthough the planning and data collection elements of CDISC are not requirements, they are necessary steps to define the studies in common terms, establishing a standardized study design and providing the basis for creating consistent CRFs.The regulatory requirements are related to standardization of the structure and format of submissible data, including:Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND)â€”non-clinical data structured for submission.Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM)â€”clinical data structured for submission.Analysis Data Model (ADaM)â€”analysis datasets generated from SDTM data.Define Extensible Markup Language (XML)â€”metadata format describing the content and structure of the SEND, SDTM and ADaM datasets.National Cancer Institute (NCI) controlled terminology3â€”consistent language used to clarify all terms in collected data.CDISC compliance can often be seen as a necessary evil, or even a box to tick on the road to regulatory approval. However, that is only true when data is reworked to comply with CDISC as an afterthought, rather than designed into the trial from the outset, thereby increasing the time and costs attributed to clinical trials. Using CDISC as a strategic tool can help organizations to find the fastest path from trial set-up to data submission, by creating pre-approved data collection tools that deliver automated, compliant metadata.Â\\xa0Creating submission-ready data brings additional benefits too, as sponsors gain an early first view on a trialâ€™s progression. In adaptive design clinical trials, early indications can allow in-trial adjustments, reallocation of drug products, and even trial stoppages, where adverse events are observed that could put patient safety in jeopardy.Cloud-based CMDRs:All-in-one, cloud-based CMDRs provide the central focus for change. They allow organizations to embrace all that built-in CDISC compliance has to offer, and they help connect the disparate metadata siloes present in clinical trial design. A CMDR is a central hub of information. Itâ€™s a single-source-of-truth for all metadata relating to clinical trials, including forms, annotations, terminologies and files. With cloud-based access, anyone, with the necessary permissions, from any location can access metadata to design and visualize eCRFs and build EDCs. Additionally, all-in-one functionality drives automated protocols, removing the risk of errors related to manual activity, and integrating disparate systems and siloed information. These features combined enable CMDRs to provide visibility, governance and collaboration between all stakeholders.Figure 2: All-in-one, cloud-based CMDRs facilitate visibility, governance and collaboration between all stakeholders.Source: FormedixOrganizations may have already invested in technology to resolve individual issues such as clinical metadata storage, standardization or study automation, and it can be tempting to plug each problem with workarounds or temporary fixes. However, this point solution-based approach can distract people from tackling the overall bigger picture issues. Advanced all-in-one, cloud-based CMDRs on the other hand, represent a long-term, system-wide solution. They enable system integrations and facilitate lasting changes that drive clinical trial efficiencies and solid return on investment (ROI).Ideally, a CMDR should be a fully integrated systemâ€”or a hub that centralizes metadata, enables access, manages standards, and provides the mechanisms for controlled change. The CMDR should communicate with existing systems via plugins or application programing interfaces (APIs), allowing data exchange and making use of existing familiar platforms and workflows, thereby reducing the amount of user training needed. (See Figure 3)The easy access that cloud-based systems provide should not be confused with control. CMDRs should be secure, allowing changes to be requested and passed through a thorough, electronic process before being accepted. Some systems allow users to create a customizable metadata lifecycle, meaning all stakeholders can see exactly which state a standard or study is in (i.e., draft, in progress, in review or approved) and only perform the actions allowed at that stage. Additionally, being able to model metadata adjustments, including standards updates, before acceptance, can provide a full impact analysis of the resulting changes on all parts of the trial and connected studies before implementation.Finally, CMDRs should offer design templates with CDISC standards embedded within their structure, ensuring all trials are built with regulatory submissions in mind. When CDISC standards are used to standardize the structures for collecting and submitting data and NCI Controlled Terminology is used to ensure semantic consistency across trials, regulatory bodies can quickly locate, view and analyze data making the review process much more straightforward.Â\\xa0Next stage benefitsCMDRs are the key to fully embracing the strategic benefits of CDISC compliance and standardization. But, by creating end-to-end metadata traceability, consistency and reuse potential, they offer much more. By embracing this new technology, organizations can increase metadata quality and consistency, expedite trial setup, and speed up data outputs.The latest CMDRs also provide the capability to design and preview eCRFs without having to build the EDC. The eCRF can be fully visualized, interrogated and refined before embarking on EDC creation, ensuring a right-first-time approach. For more complex trials, multiple EDCs can be built from the one CMDR directly from the specification, further reducing trial setup times and removing the errors associated with manual creation from external spreadsheets or forms.By designing standardization into the trial and automating SDTM outputs, organizations can produce submission-ready data without the manual rework needed to meet regulatory requirements.Figure 3: Using APIs with CMDRs and existing technology.Source: FormedixWhile there has been a lag in implementation of these platforms, another driving force is that CDISC standards are now required by several regulatory authorities and the CDISC 360 project is already underway to build on the existing standards and enable end-to-end automation of study specification and data processing.4 As the CDISC standards continue to be updated, organizations will benefit from understanding how they can be incorporated into their processes to drive efficiency improvements; CMDRs can be enablers for this work.The challenges that hinder the implementation of CMDRs today will be magnified in the future if organizations continue to resist change. Siloed datasets and manual processes need to be fixed and legacy systems need to be connected. But when these problems are left to fester, they grow. As the number of clinical trials increases and researchers respond to the needs of a growing and aging population, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and contract research organizations will need to run faster, more efficient and more cost-effective trials to compete in this space.Put simply, investing time at the outset by implementing an all-in-one, cloud-based CMDR can deliver many long-term benefits. This technology promises a future of even greater potential as more APIs feed in and out of safety platforms, EDCs, third-party platforms and internal databases. With the inclusion of clinical trial metadata in semantically rich formatsâ€”including from non-traditional devices such as wearablesâ€”the industry should realize an abundant source of insight. CMDRs will play a central role in organizing and standardizing this data to extract real-world meaning. With a focus on creating a central hub for clinical metadata, organizations are set to benefit from the collaboration, reuse, compliance and consistency that CMDRs bring to power trial improvements.Gilbert HunterÂ\\xa0is a Customer Success Manager at FormedixReferenceshttps://www.cdisc.org/ visited on 25 May 2021.https://www.cdisc.org/resources/global-regulatory-requirements visited on 26 May 2021.https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ visited on 25 May 2021.https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-360 visited on 26 May 2021.'},\n",

The full details appear in the manual, and I leave ACT readers with more specific interests to peruse it at their leisure.But among the highlights of the promised new approach is \"more equitable access for those with severe diseases\", which will be affected in part by new weightings for innovation support. This will \"put the impact on patientâ€™s lives at the heart of NICEâ€™s work, while creating a more equitable platform.\"There will also be \"decision-making flexibility where it counts\". The proposals are for NICEâ€™s decision-making committees to \"use their flexibility when challenged with complex innovative technologies and those for children or rare diseases, to ensure patients benefit from the most cutting-edge therapies sooner, without barrier or delay\". The flexibility will however be \"clearly defined, transparent and predictable\", it adds.An emphasis is put on \"embracing the full evidence base and new data sources\", explicitly including real-world evidence. Again, the description is phrased as if from the pen of a communications consultant inebriated with the exuberance of his or her own verbosity: it \"will mean industry will have clarity and predictability for their submissions, while ensuring high quality data continues to provide the backbone for robust, rapid decision making from committees\", and \"allow companies to plan their evidence collection within the trial and data environment in the NHS.\"Once the decorative wording has been disregarded and dismissed by those seeking information rather than spin, the responses to the consultation will doubtlessly be at least as interesting as the proposals themselvesâ€”and as the autumn advances, this columnist looks forward to hearing more about the review from stakeholders rather than from spin-doctors.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Since the FDA published its report, â€œGuidance for Industry: Oversight of Clinical Investigationsâ€”A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoringâ€\\x9d in 2011, risk-based monitoring (RBM) has become a guidance document that lays out the FDAâ€™s expectations. Later on, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted ICH E6 (R2) and made it a requirement.Although robust centralized monitoring (CM) ensures risk-based quality monitoring (RBQM) success, regulatory agencies often provide a general framework to this process without specifying exactly how it should be done. Due to the complexity and a lack of guidance within RBM, itâ€™s crucial that CM teams develop critical-thinking skills to effectively run these operations. Critical thinking helps CM teams understand root causes, reduce the rate of false positive signals, determine next steps in an investigation and recommend risk mitigations.While plenty of skill-based CM trainings exist for clinical trials, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), regulation and data management, critical-thinking education has yet to arrive and require more complex approach involving variety of formats and activities. Through our research, we found that the ability to develop critical thinking is not only possible but can help pharma companies in being more efficient in their overall RBM strategy, from more accurate decoding of the risk signals and mitigation actions up to the continuous improvements, and improved retention ability.What is critical thinking?Critical thinking has many definitions and interpretations, which makes it hard to grasp.Â\\xa0Benjamin Bloomâ€™s taxonomy model offers a practical approach to understanding where and how critical thinking occurs. The model provides a hierarchy for achieving a higher order of thinking through knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.Figure 1:Â\\xa0Bloom taxonomy pyramid for higher order thinkingHow to develop critical thinking within CM teamsThe best way to enhance CM critical thinking is through a combination of learning and practicing opportunities, which the International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education1 says is achievable through determining objectives; encouraging discussions and questions; allowing active learning; reviewing, refining and improving processes; and providing feedback.Applying this framework to the Bloom taxonomy pyramid can create a practical approach to the team development of and training strategy for critical thinking (figure 3).Figure 2.Â\\xa0Bloom taxonomy centralized team activities and examplesKnowledge: Formed by experiences, history and what we observe and learn through others, knowledge is the foundation of critical thinking. In CM teams, knowledge areas include clinical trials, GCP and regulation, risk management, data management, analytics and data science. Both passive and active learning2â€”reading, hearing and watching versus collaborative workshops, respectivelyâ€”should be employed here. External collaboration groups can be found through professional public sources and RBQM providers, while internal knowledge exchange efforts can be enhanced through engaging with external experts.Â\\xa0Comprehension: Comprehension occurs by connecting company processes, risk strategy, analytics and study design. Many of these elements are reflected in standard operating procedures (SOP), risk assessment categorization tools (RACT) and other plans. Connecting risk-indicator (KRI) definitions to the process steps, case report forms (CRF), protocol assessment schedule, study endpoints, safety and design is essential here. Risk indicators can be designed differently in terms of methods and elements, either through normalizations, study phases, randomization or cohorts. CM teams can assess their comprehension level by evaluating how risk category, risk indicators and events are connected; how study design affects risks throughout the study; what indicator elements are referenced in study and process documents; and what the main outcome of the centralized monitoring review should be.Application: Shadowing an experienced colleague is a valuable way to transition onto the Application phase. This is the initial step in forming questions and represents the point when mentoring and active discussions become beneficial for understanding the process. Continuing the business cases and lessons-learned review complements the ability to apply acquired knowledge.Analysis: Analysis typically includes categorizing, examining and comparing risk factors, among a multitude of other activities; these steps contribute to having a structured approach, which helps direct the flow of thinking. Being an operational aspect of RBQM, CM is deeply rooted in quality management. The Pareto Principal and Fishbone diagrams (figure 4) are widely used in both quality and risk management areas, since their cause-and-effect themes help organize root-cause-analysis investigations. Such diagrams allow CM teams to develop initial assumptions quicker while allocating more time toÂ\\xa0investigate less common risk signals. Based on our experience, most causes arise from people, data and analytics, systems, process and documents, and environments.Figure 3.Â\\xa0Fishbone diagram of root-cause analysis of RBQM signalsSynthesis: Synthesis is the ability to apply knowledge, provide meaningful outcomes and see the big picture. At this point, central monitors will start composing a risk story based on the hypothesis. Continuing to be mentored and participate in collaboration groups and historical risks reviews are highly recommended here. CM teams at this stage should consider what other assumptions can be made; if risk signals and assumptions align with processes, documents and trainings; how risk signals differ across entities; and further investigation needs.Evaluation: Through producing a final report and assessing the outcome, the evaluation stage concludes the critical thinking cycle and overall process. Still, continuing open discussions among teams is one of the best ways to support and expand the team knowledge and understanding of the risk-based monitoring approach, while external collaboration groups can enhance, benchmark and gain some comfort in this area.Moving forwardIn the RBQM world, itâ€™s easy for CM teams to get caught up in the review of isolated key risk indicators (KRI) or use a one-size-fits-all framework to address risks across the portfolio. Doing soâ€”and losing sight of the big picture and impact of the study designâ€”provides a fragmented viewpoint and will eventually mislead everyone. By developing this higher level of critical thinking, CM teams can create a comprehensive risk story and properly direct mitigations throughout their organization. Additionally, it promotes a culture of honest discussions and open-mindedness to support RBQM ecosystem in your organization. Moving forward, the more CM teams develop their critical thinking capabilities, the more theyâ€™ll maximize RBQM efficiency and effectiveness.Vera Pomerantseva, MS, PMP is quality and risk management lead in ZSâ€™s Princeton Office.Referenceshttps://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE55.pdf?pagewanted=allhttps://sites.google.com/site/andreasportfoliopedagogy/7-passive-vs-active-learning'},\n",

              "  'C': 'The first COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, has received FDA approval. How will vaccination rates be effected?',\n",
              "  'D': 'After weeks of anticipation, FDA has granted full approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech anti-COVID 19 vaccine, raising hopes that this action will help overcome the vaccine hesitancy that has plagued efforts to broadly immunize the U.S. population. The decision announced Aug. 23, 2021 was no surprise, as staff in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) have been working overtime to review extensive clinical data contained in thousands of documents as quickly as possible. Consequently, FDA fully assessed the Pfizer BLA (biologics license application) in 40% of the time allotted for this process, producing a decision that hopefully will â€œgive people confidence to get vaccinated,â€\\x9d said CBER director Peter Marks at a press conference. FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock termed the approval decision â€œa pivotal momentâ€\\x9d in the fight against the pandemic, noting that the BLA should make the public â€œconfident that this vaccine meets the FDAâ€™s gold standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality that we require for an approved product.â€\\x9dThe approved vaccine now carries the brand name Comirnaty, devised for the manufacturers by the Brand Institute to convey a sense of â€œcommunityâ€\\x9d and â€œimmunization.â€\\x9d FDA notes that the manufacturers now may promote the vaccine according to its rules, efforts that hopefully will further encourage vaccination in the U.S. and elsewhere. Such uptake may be advanced by vaccination mandates from federal, state and local government agencies. President Biden remarked that the BLA should be a signal to both public and private employers to move forward with vaccine requirements. The Pentagon has announced plans to mandate vaccination for military forces, both active duty and reserve units, while hospitals and nursing homes look to require such protection for all staffers.The manufacturers note that Comirnaty has been administered to more than 1 billion patients around the world. Production is slated to increase from 1.2 billion vaccine doses so far to three billion this year and four billion doses in 2022, according to the manufacturers. The partners also plan to seek licensure of a third, or booster, dose via a supplemental BLA, and to extend full approval to individuals over 12 years of age. Patients age 12 to 16 still can obtain the vaccine under the emergency use authorization (EUA) that remains in effect, as can immunocompromised individuals seeking a third booster shot to protect against the delta variant.The BLA package submitted in May 2021 included longer-term follow-up data from its Phase III clinical trial plus extensive information on manufacturing and facilities. We didnâ€™t â€œjust look at data summaries,â€\\x9d commented Marks. He explained that the task of evaluating the Pfizer/BioNTech BLA involved reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of reports, including four months of follow-up data on half of the 40,000 clinical trial participants. Staff also visited sites where the clinical trials were conducted to ensure that the information was collected accurately and met all standards. FDA wanted to ensure â€œthat we saw all adverse events,â€\\x9d Marks said, adding that FDA also did a full benefit-risk assessment based on real world data for the hundreds of millions of patients that have received the vaccine over the past year.The BLA review process also involved visiting numerous manufacturing facilities to ensure quality production. The manufacturers noted in a press release that there is no change in the formulation for Comirnaty, and that providers may continue to use already distributed product obtained under the EUA.The FDA approval letter for Comirnaty also specifies a number of post-approval studies and commitments to further assess product safety and efficacy. These include additional studies on the risks for myocarditis and pericarditis after receiving Comirnaty, a side effect that has been seen and assessed by FDA, notably in younger male patients. The companies also will create a registry to monitor the vaccineâ€™s impact on pregnant women and infants.FDAâ€™s action represents the agencyâ€™s first approval of a vaccine using messenger RNA technology, a move expected to further bolster R&D on therapies and preventives in this area. Further evidence of the vaccineâ€™s safety and efficacy will hopefully encourage broader public vaccination and begin to rein in the now-resurgent COVID pandemic.'},\n",

              "  'C': 'While biopharma companies will pay more than $3 million to file an NDA or BLA application during fiscal year 2022, new fees for generic drugs will see modest or no increases and those for biosimilars may drop or hold even.',\n",
              "  'D': 'Biopharmaceutical companies will pay more than $3 million to file an application seeking FDA approval of a new drug (NDA) or biologic (BLA) during fiscal year 2022. This record charge to evaluate new drugs and biologics reflects agency analysis of additional personnel and resources needed to process its growing workload1,2 The annual program fee paid by each manufacturer with marketed prescription drugs holds fairly even at about $370,000. And while the actual increase in the application fee is not that much, passing the $3 million mark has drawn attentionâ€”and further concern about FDAâ€™s overdependence on revenue from regulated industry.At the same time, new fees for generic drugs, biosimilars, medical devices, animal drugs and outsourcing facilities (drug compounders) will see modestâ€”or noâ€”increases. Most notable is that fees for developing and filing applications for new biosimilars will drop or hold even.3 With program reserves higher than expected, CDER halved fees for establishing, maintaining and reactivating biosimilar product development (BPD) programs. Application fees for biosimilars remain at $1.7 million, and annual program fees at slightly more than $300,000.Similarly, generic drug fees remain fairly flat. Filing an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) will cost $226,000, while the annual program fee stays at about $1.5 million. Fees for each manufacturing facility will range from $42,000 for a domestic API producer to $210,000 for a foreign manufacturer of finished dosage forms.4These varying fees for applications, facilities and annual program oversight for medical products reflect the range in FDA oversight of differing R&D and manufacturing operations. Sponsors usually submit fairly few NDAs a year, and thus pay high rates for those, compared to the program fee. But as generic drug makers often file multiple ANDAs and maintain many facilities, the individual fees are lower, compared to a relatively higher annual program fee, which varies with company size. And because FDA provides considerable support and advice to biosimilar makers during product development, that fee program begins prior to filing an application; the application fee is less than for an NDA but much more than for an ANDA.FDA bases its rates for FY 2022 on projections that sponsors will submit 161 NDAs/BLAs to CDER, about 1350 efficacy and labeling supplements, and 2388 manufacturing supplements. The program will fund the cost of holding some 4500 meetings with sponsors and oversee more than 9,500 active INDs. Workload increases at both CDER and CBER altogether will require a $27 million increase in PDUFA fees to reach $1.149 billion in FY 2022.The fees set for fiscal year 2022 (begins Oct. 1, 2021) are noteworthy, as their announcement comes as FDA and industry are finalizing agreements for new five-year user fee programs. These need to be reauthorized by Congress early next year in order to start collecting new fees Oct. 1 2022. PDUFA application fees are slated to increase to $4 million over the next five-year fee program, which will be specified along with multiple other revisions in new â€œcommitment lettersâ€\\x9d that FDA has negotiated with industry for its various user fee programs (PDUFA VII, BsUFA III, GDUFA III). The process of enacting legislation to reauthorize the fees every five years provides members of Congress with an opportunity to add a broad range of policy and program requirements that often impose notable changes on FDA operations and priorities.Referenceshttps://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/prescription-drug-user-fee-amendmentshttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/08/16/2021-17505/prescription-drug-user-fee-rates-for-fiscal-year-2022https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/biosimilar-user-fee-amendmentshttps://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/generic-drug-user-fee-amendments'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Agile and inventive pandemic response augurs in future ready clinical trial managementThe onset of a global health emergency set innovation engines rolling, with active participation across the clinical research spectrum to find effective solutions. There were considerable, dynamic changes to clinical trial management during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to cope with the movement restrictions and the risk of infection. Logistical challenges were rapidly solved using technological prowess and digital tools, forcing the pharmaceutical industry to view clinical trial operations in a new light.Here are 5 landmark solutions that were woven into the existing clinical trial fabric, with agility and innovation, to strengthen processes and make it relevant to current needs and beyond.1. Accelerated trials to market lifesaving drugs fasterWhen scientists began the process of developing a vaccine against COVID-19 in early 2020, the fastest vaccine that had been developed till then was the mumps vaccine in 4 years during the early 1960s. However, on Dec. 2, 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use in less than a year. The development of vaccines for COVID-19 showed that the process could be accelerated, without any compromise on safety.2. Decentralized trials to circumvent disruptionsThe move towards decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) was an effort that helped bridge the logistic nightmare posed due to COVID-19 mediated restrictions and paved the way for patient-centric measures. The CAGR for drug-based interventional DCTs was 7% between the years 2014 to 2019, while during the COVID-19 pandemic it grew to 77% between the latter half of 2019 and in 2020.13. Patient centricity to improve participationAccording to Global Data, 67.3% of trial disruption that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was due to suspended patient enrolment, while 14.4% of trial disruption was due to slow patient enrolment.2 This highlights the need for improved patient engagement through innovation in clinical trials, like the use of e-consent forms and electronic health records (EHR).4. Telemedicine to ensure trial continuityWith the global pandemic posing unprecedented challenges in movement, telemedicine aided in improved connectivity and engagement with clinical trial participants. Telehealth companies have reported an over 800% increase in telehealth app downloads during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Global telemedicine market is expected to rise at nearly 38% CAGR, from $38.7 billion in 2020 to an expected $191.7 billion in 2025.5. Technology-driven support to ensure risk mitigationCertain elements in clinical trials existed long before COVID-19 but their use and benefits have resulted in such vital tools becoming permanent fixtures. Navitas Life Sciencesâ€™ OneClinicalÂ® Analytics platform is an artificial intelligence tool that has been shown to reduce clinical trial monitoring costs by 50% while bringing down cycle time by 30%.3 The near-real-time data insights gained from such tools aid in taking proactive corrective action helps resolve critical clinical trial issues at the onset, allowing intelligent deployment of resources.The future of clinical trials promises to be more patient-centric and is peppered with innovation to bring down the time and cost needed to deliver drugs to the market efficiently.References1.

              "  'C': 'The White House is looking to pay for some of its prime social and health initiatives by reducing outlays for prescription drugs, according to an announcement by President Biden.',\n",
              "  'D': 'The White House is looking to pay for some of its prime social and health initiatives by reducing outlays for prescription drugs, according to an announcement by President Joe Biden that supports several leading drug-price control policies strongly backed by Democrats.1 Thereâ€™s not much new on the reform list, but the emphasis is designed to gain support for broader spending measures from both party centrists and reformers, as well as some Republicans.The lead proposal reiterates earlier calls for granting Medicare authority to negotiate drug prices. Here the change would apply only to â€œa subset of expensive drugs that donâ€™t face any competition on the market,â€\\x9d a more limited list of therapies that lack generic alternatives. And the plan does not aim to aim to compel price negotiations by linking reform to an international reference price or by challenging manufacturer intellectual property.The administration also calls for penalties on pharma companies that raise prices faster than inflation. And it seeks to establish â€œa firm capâ€\\x9d on the amount that Medicare beneficiaries have to pay out-of-pocket for drugs each year, with some of the reforms offsetting that added cost.Drug importing and support for generics and biosimilars are on the table, as the plan repeats earlier proposals for federal agencies to work with states and Tribes to â€œimport safe, lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada.â€\\x9d Similar initiatives by the Trump administration and others have backed drug importing plans, but implementation has proven difficult and unrewarding.Access vs. costsWhile the White House announcement signals the administrationâ€™s continued intent to make prescription drugs more affordable and less burdensome for consumers, this latest plan basically adds new emphasis to policy changes in this area. In response to Bidenâ€™s announcement, PhRMA president Stephen Ubl blamed high drug costs on insurance industry policies and warned that the presidentâ€™s policies would â€œundermine access to life-saving medicines.â€\\x9d2 PhRMA looks to shift the policy debate to measures designed to reduce health care costs overall, as opposed to specific drug pricing proposals, and to build on broader public applause for industryâ€™s success in fast development of anti-COVID vaccines and therapies.A recent posting by the Biotechnology Innovative Organization (BIO) highlights a range of state initiatives that set payment limits on drug outlays. These include new laws requiring drug price transparency and notices of price increases; programs to link local drug prices to those in Canada; and rule updates to permit pharmacies to dispense interchangeable biosimilars.3At the same time, consumer advocacy groups penned a letter to Health & Human Services (HHS) secretary Xavier Becerra seeking to combat high drug prices by limiting patent monopolies of brands seen to stifle generic competition.4 The group led by Public Citizen emphasizes that HHS already has authority to establish generic competitors to patented drugs, including the exercise of â€œmarch-inâ€\\x9d rights on drug patents developed with federal funding.The administration is looking for its drug pricing reform to help build support for a $3.5 trillion social policy bill backed by Democrats and headed for consideration as part of a massive budget reconciliation package moving through Congress. Here, a significant drug pricing package will be proposed to offset some of its considerable costs, particularly those to expand Medicare to younger age groups and to add vision and hearing benefits and long-term care.Meanwhile, the $1 trillion infrastructure package just approved by the Senate with bipartisan support includes only one drug pricing provisionâ€”a proposed delay in implementing the â€œrebate ruleâ€\\x9d authorized by the Trump administrationâ€”a policy that limits manufacturer rebates on drugs covered by Medicare Part D unless the rebates are passed through to the dispensing pharmacy to benefit consumers. The new rule was calculated to cost the government nearly $200 million over ten years, so the added delay provides a â€œsavings,â€\\x9d much applauded by PBMs and health insurers that currently benefit from manufacturer rebates.Referenceshttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-calls-on-congress-to-lower-prescription-drug-prices/https://phrma.org/resource-center/Topics/Cost-and-Value/PhRMA-Statement-on-President-Bidens-Remarks-to-Lower-Prescription-Drug-Priceshttps://go.bio.org/index.php/email/emailWebview?md_id=29781https://www.citizen.org/article/civil-society-organizations-call-on-the-department-of-health-and-human-services-to-combat-excessive-drug-prices/'},\n",

              "  'C': 'Bringing clinical trials to patientsâ€™ homes can address existing site-based challenges.',\n",
              "  'D': 'Those who have conducted pediatric oncology clinical trials know all too well that site-based treatment can create barriers that prevent patients from receiving potentially life-altering therapies.Important financial, transportation and other social issues can affect parentsâ€™ ability to bring their immunocompromised children into research centers. Unaddressed, these issues can result in low enrollment and high dropout rates for clinical trials, delaying study completion and slowing the availability of promising therapies to more families.Earlier this year, the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group (COG) and Signify Health set out on a mission to address some of these barriers by meeting pediatric patients where they are: inthe home.We started this work by creating an in-home option for children diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). B-ALL is the most common childhood cancer, representing 20% of diagnoses in children younger than 15 years old and the leading disease-related cause of death for children ages one to 19 years. Promising new therapies have the potential to alter the course of B-ALL progression, so removing barriers to clinical trial participation is a primary focus for researchers.AALL1731 (NCT03914625) is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Amgen, and is currently open at 195 U.S. COG sites. COG and Signify Health are partnering to make in-home infusion services available for patients who are randomized to receive blinatumomab on AALL1731 and who are unable to access outpatient pumps and homecare. Amgen has provided funding to NCI under the CRADA to help more pediatric patients receive blinatumomab at home.We are delighted that after months of preparation, AALL1731 is now available on an in-home basis for eligible patients who choose it. Our experience may be instructive for other study sponsors and investigators considering making an in-home option available, and we thought it would be helpful to share insights around key areas of focus for our team.Ensuring that the family is preparedHaving a stranger in the home and administering a potent drug to your child, can be a scary, overwhelming experience. So we put ourselves in the patientâ€™s and familiesâ€™ shoes, asking ourselves: What can we do to make this easier for the family? How can we make this less intimidating for the patient? What will make the patient as comfortable as possible? Ultimately, everyone involved in the clinical trial wants the families to know that we all care about the patient as much as they do.We approached this challenge by designating one point of contact from Signify to answer all of the patientâ€™s and familyâ€™s questions, be on call as often as necessary, proactively seeking their feedback after each visit, and coordinating all logistics with the clinician, the hospital and the researchers. This personalized approach makes the first visit that much easier.Ensuring that the nurse clinician is preparedNot only do the families need to be prepared, but the visiting nurse clinician also needs to have everything readily available to administer the therapy and follow the protocol. Our teams prepared a bag of everything that might be needed: tubing for infusions, various sizes of needles for blood draws, copious amounts of PPE, proper waste disposal (baggies, containers, etc.), even a thermometerâ€”anything that would be readily available to healthcare workers in the hospital must be on hand for them in the home.In-home delivery would also not be possible without technology that enables everyoneâ€”Signify, COG, the nurse clinician, and clinical coordinatorsâ€”to communicate and coordinate. Clinical trial protocols and all of our in-home standard operating procedures (for example, what to do if the patient is not home, what to do if the patient has a high fever) are uploaded to an iPad that is kept with the materials. Any issues immediately trigger a call from the nurse clinician in the home to the patientâ€™s managing physician to discuss the finding and next steps.And of course, one of the many important considerations when delivering continuously infused medications at home for pediatric patients; given that there may be curious siblings running around the home, we placed a lock on the materials to ensure safe keeping.Ensuring that the timing alignsIn clinical trials, timing is everything. For the AALL1731 trial, blinatumomab has a very short half life and thus must be delivered intravenously for 28 days, 24 hours per day. So when a patient is approved for discharge from the hospital, the visiting nurse clinician has a very small window of time that they can arrive at the patientâ€™s home to initiate the treatmentâ€”they must hook up the patient within four hours of leaving the hospital. Once in the home, patient metrics are documented in real-time and then the nurse clinician is on call for the first 24 hours after a bag change to address any potential pump malfunctions.Ensuring that the timing matches up at each touchpoint is no easy featâ€”and given that we do our best to send the same provider each time, it can be even more challenging. We have to prepare for all scenarios which require flawless logistics, streamlined technology and timely communications.Bringing it all homeAs in-home clinical trials become more commonplace, a critical component of their success will be the development of clear and forward-thinking plans for managing the clinical trial in the home setting. Our experience has shown us that by offering this easier way for patients to participate in clinical trialsâ€”for example by bringing clinical trials to them, in their homesâ€”we can help bring new, life-saving therapies to patients around the world.Marc Rothman, MD, CMO, Signify Health, Mignon Loh, MD, COG ALL Committee ChairDownload Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-08-01-2021'},\n",

These physiciansâ€” Ron Blair, MD, President, Forest Lane Pediatrics; Charlotte Grayson, MD, Partner and Internist, First Georgia Physician Group and Tina Kennelly, MD, Director of Tryon Medical Partnersâ€”have only been in research for approximately one year. Jennifer Byrne, CEO of Javara, an Integrated Research Organization (IRO) which brings clinical research into healthcare organizations allowing patients and doctors access to trials at the point of care, served as moderator of the discussion. While the physician investigators did partner with Javara to integrate clinical trials into their practices, the insights they shared were specific to their practiceâ€™s and patientsâ€™ experiences. Byrne acknowledged that their combined efforts led to 2,000 people being enrolled in clinical trials that a year ago would not have had exposure. Byrne also acknowledged that Javara moves â€œtogether in partnership with like-minded healthcare organizations, providers, healthcare leaders that actually see the value in research.â€\\x9dWhat follows is a summary of their discussion.Grayson is partner and internist at First Georgia Physician Group located in Fayetteville, Georgia, about 30 miles south of Atlanta. The population around the multi-specialty practice is suburban, somewhat rural, but also draws on the southern Atlanta area. The internal medicine patients start at 18 years of age through end of life and the practice treats many palliative care and hospice patients, as well as complex cases of patients throughout the range of internal medicine. Grayson also noted that the patients were very diverse, with a 90% female base, and a majority of African American, Latino or Southeast Asian descent. â€œThe opportunity to bring research to this population, who tend to be underrepresented in clinical trials, was something I was really excited about. But I also knew that I was going to be facing some challenges with these patients, where many have never heard of research,â€\\x9d Grayson said.For the majority of physicians in Graysonâ€™s practice, their exposure to research was limited to their residency and training days. They needed refresher-training, as well as full training for the staff, to learn how to present research to patients and answer questions. â€œAs we started to ramp up clinical trials, we did a kind of bedside education with them so that they understood what these trials were and how to interact with our patients.â€\\x9dTryon Medical Partners, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is a fairly new practice, which broke off from a nearby hospital system approximately three years ago. The multi-specialty group includes cardiology, dermatology, rheumatology, endocrinology, as well as Kennellyâ€™s specialty internal medicine. She says her primary focus is on womenâ€™s health and preventative care. The group didnâ€™t have a formal research department and wanted to offer research as an option for patients because of what they felt were the inherent patient benefits. â€œWe thought that it would provide a higher touch option for patients. Maybe patients who werenâ€™t as well controlled in their diabetes could get enrolled in a diabetic study and we could couple them with trainers, as well as clinical trial navigators and get them involved. Again, providing a high touch option that would hopefully improve their care overall.â€\\x9dKennelly explained that the group began with smaller trials, an anxiety trial and atrial fibrillation, both device trials. But when they were offered COVID vaccine trials, they had to ramp up research pretty quickly. Of the one hundred physicians in the practice, 50% have been trained as investigators or sub investigators. â€œIt took a lot of support and infrastructure to get our groupâ€”who was pretty naive because we are a young practiceâ€”where we are today. Weâ€™ve done the Moderna COVID vaccine trial, as well as the Janssen ENSEMBLE 3001 trial. So having a lot of support on the ground with Javara integrated into our clinical atmosphere helped us get patients involved and enrolled in these trials.â€\\x9dRon Blair has nearly 30 years of experience caring for pediatric patients. His practice in Northern Texas, Forest Lane Pediatrics, has a primary focus on infants to age 19, but also includes a multi-specialty group with internal medicine, family practice, and OB-GYN among other specialties. Blair began working with Javara earlier than the other two practices, and he said the relationship has benefited his patients, in addition to being fun and interesting. â€œWeâ€™ve taken a step-by-step approach with a lot of guidance from Javara because our group didnâ€™t have extensive experience with [clinical trials]. We spent time training our clinical investigators and preparing a nice portfolio of our different specialties,â€\\x9d said Blair.The patientsFor the patients, Kennelly thinks they have a better sense of support when they are involved with research. â€œFor some of these trials, weâ€™re seeing patients once every other month, but in between, weâ€™re talking to them on the phone. Sometimes once or twice a week, sometimes every day for a couple of days for short periods of time. That allows them to voice their concerns and ask questions, and it allows more interactions for the physician or the PI or sub investigator. The patients also interact with the clinical trial navigators and assistants. Overall, the patient does enjoy the experience and when integrated with primary care and their own PCPs, I think clinical trial retention rates are higher because of the attention from their provider.â€\\x9dAs predicted, Grayson said their staff spent time with patients helping them understand their clinical research options. â€œI did notice many patients, in some respects, still have a lot of mistrust for the medical community. But I have found that they actually do trust their provider. And if we come to them and talk to them about the benefits of the research, they trust that coming from their own provider,â€\\x9d she said. Grayson also sees that the patients are excited to participate when asked, and spread the word to friends and family. Because of the practice population, and history of underrepresentation, Grayson believes that the clinical research information and understanding for them is enlightening. And she believes that in the bigger picture, it is important to continue to try to include these populations.Blairâ€™s practice initially sent queries to patients in the form of a survey asking if they would be interested in participating in relevant clinical trials. The response was more enthusiastic than they predicted. â€œWhen we interview people, there are several questions about clinical research. Our patients trust our ongoing focus on their continuum of care and gladly share appropriate information relevant to potential clinical trials. So itâ€™s been very good for the patients and good for my staff and good for the other physicians involved.â€\\x9dBlair, who did have exposure to clinical research during his residency training, is proud of the number of physicians who signed on for clinical investigator training. â€œItâ€™s pretty exciting for all of us to be involved in contributing to the fund of knowledge. And also that weâ€™re able to provide services and potential treatments to our patients that we would not have been able to previously.â€\\x9d Blair credits Javara for opening doors to research for practicing physicians that previously was just in the domain of academic institutions.Download Issue : Applied Clinical Trials-08-01-2021'},\n",

              "  'D': 'For years, physicians and medical students, most of them people of color, have tried to highlight the scarcity of images of black and brown people in medical curricula. A study published in 2018 that reviewed over 4,000 images in textbooks that are commonly used in top medical schools, such as The Atlas of Human Anatomy and Grayâ€™s Anatomy for Students, found that only 4.5% of images represented dark skin tones.1 As such, while the formal medical curriculum clearly emphasizes equality of care, this message is undermined by the poor representation of people of color in textbooks, case studies, and training materials. Critically, this uneven representation that places a white person as the normative patient has been identified as a significant contributor to racial inequality in health care experience, treatment, and patient outcomes.2Although the underrepresentation of images of people of color in the medical curriculum is an issue that affects training in every branch of medicine, it is especially problematic for dermatology where diagnosis and assessment of the severity of a condition depends almost entirely on the appearance of the skin. In the US, coverage of dark skin at national meetings and in images included in core dermatology educational resources is limited and variable.3 A study published this year focusing on dermatology textbooks found that only 11.5% of images showed dark skin.4 This is echoed by dermatologists and dermatology residents in the US, who report that they have been inadequately trained in identifying conditions on dark skin, and see the need for greater exposure to images of people of color in training materials.5Creating awarenessRecently, there has been a growing movement online aimed at tackling this issue. Brown Skin Matters (@brownskinmatters) is an Instagram account with reference images of dermatological conditions on non-white skin, aiming to help people of color identify skin conditions. It was launched in 2019 by Ellen Buchanan Weiss after her son, who is mixed race, broke out in a rash and she could not find any images online that matched what she was seeing on his skin. Last summer, Malone Mukwende, a second-year medical student from St. Georgeâ€™s Medical School in London, cowrote a handbook named Mind the Gap, which aims to raise awareness on how symptoms and signs of conditions can manifest differently on dark skin. Multiple articles featuring these initiatives as well as highlighting the need for better representation of dark skin in dermatology training have followed, including pieces in Stat News, The Guardian, NPR, and The Washington Post. This online movement demonstrates that, unlike other pervasive economic,6 historic,7 and cultural barriers8 to health for people of color, the underrepresentation of dark skin in training materials can be remedied. By improving the tools and education provided to clinicians, they can be better positioned in diagnosing and treating skin conditions in people of color. In addition to improving standard of care, diversifying training can provide significant benefits to clinical research in dermatology. For a trial to yield the most meaningful results that are applicable across the entire patient population, assessments supporting endpoints need to be measured in the most accurate and consistent manner.Identifying the conditionAtopic dermatitis is a common chronic skin condition that typically presents during early childhood but can persist into adulthood. Due to a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, the immune system becomes overactive, triggering inflammation that damages the skin barrier. This leaves the skin dry, itchy, and scaly. Atopic dermatitis can often create a vicious cycle where children itch and scratch and itch and scratch, causing further inflammation and damaging the skin. Black skin is significantly associated with the presence of this condition,9 and Black children are more often seen by clinicians for a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis compared to white children,10 suggesting either an increased prevalence or severity.11Â\\xa0In clinical trials the effectiveness of a medication in treating atopic dermatitis is determined using clinician-reported outcome measures, such as the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). For the IGA, the clinician scores the overall appearance of the skin affected by selecting one of five severity grades. Achievement of IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) has been the primary definition of treatment success. The scoring process for the EASI is more extensive. For four different body areas (head, trunk, arms, and legs) the clinician evaluates how much of the skin is affected and how intense the characteristic signs of the condition are. These signs are erythema (redness), induration (thickening), excoriation (most likely due to scratching) and lichenification (i.e. how leathery, akin to a lichen, the skin appears). A total score is then calculated by taking into account the area affected and the severity of the signs. What is common in these and other clinician-reported outcome measures in dermatology is that they very much depend on the clinicianâ€™s judgement.The inherent subjectivity of these measures often results in disagreement between cliniciansâ€™ ratings on the severity of a patientâ€™s condition. Hanifin and colleagues (2001)12 tested the reliability of the EASI by exploring score agreement between clinicians (inter-rater variability) and within the same clinician across time (intra-rater variability). To achieve this, 15 dermatologists assessed 20 children and adult patients with atopic dermatitis twice over two days. Overall, inter- and intra-rater variability for the EASI total score was found to be fair-to-good. However, when exploring the scores for each individual sign of atopic dermatitis independently, agreement between the raters was evidently poorer: thickness, scratching, and lichenification showed poor or fair inter-rater variability, with only erythema crossing the threshold to good for both assessment timings. Other studies exploring the reliability of clinician reported measures for atopic dermatitis have found similar results, with scores on the most commonly used assessments in clinical trials showing either poor or moderate agreement between clinicians (e.g. Silverberg et al. (2021)).13Studies have specifically focused on how agreement in cliniciansâ€™ scores on dermatology assessments differ across skin types. When it comes specifically to patients of color, rater variability has been found to be disproportionately high for dark skin. For example, Zhao and colleagues (2015)14 compared the reliability of clinician scores on the most common assessments used in clinical trials for atopic dermatitis, including the EASI. They found that across all assessments, inter-rater variability was higher the darker the skin of the patient being assessed, and that reliability was poorest for patients with highly pigmented skin. A significant part of this disagreement was due to a high degree of variability in cliniciansâ€™ scores of erythema on highly pigmented skin. When erythema was excluded from the assessment of disease severity and the score was adjusted, disease was found to be significantly more severe. These results echoed the well-reported challenge that dermatologists have detecting erythema in heavily pigmented skin,15 resulting in patients with dark skin that have cutaneous diseases such atopic dermatitis being underdiagnosed and undertreated.16For clinical research in dermatology to yield meaningful results applicable across the disease population, the most relevant outcomesâ€“such as the EASI in atopic dermatitisâ€“need to be measured in the most accurate and consistent manner. Critical to this is ensuring that every clinician rating disease severity understands the scores in the same way and administers the assessments in the same way every single time. Training raters who will administer the assessments prior to the initiation of a clinical trial can ensure their scores of patientsâ€™ disease severity during the trial are calibrated, reducing variability. Rater training has been used extensively for clinicians assessing patients in clinical trials on central nervous system disorders, where outcomes are often semi-structured interviews that rely heavily on clinical judgement,17 but only recently has been identified as important for endpoint quality in dermatology clinical trials.In a recent study, Olt and colleagues (2019)18 investigated the impact of standardizing training on the EASI for clinicians participating in a US nationwide trial. Clinicians were trained on a detailed explanation of the assessment, along with consensus building exercises with expert trainers that involved example images with varying severity of atopic dermatitis signs. The participating clinicians then took part in a test-retest certification test aimed to establish competence and determine inter-rater variability. This certification exercise consisted of two sessions, 5-10 days apart, where a set of case studies with different disease severity were presented, and the clinicians were asked to rate them. The findings demonstrated that variability in clinicianâ€™s EASI scores were significantly reduced after they received training, clearly showing that standardized rater training can align clinical judgement thus improving data reliability and quality.Ensuring consistency and equalityGiven the underrepresentation of dark skin in the medical curriculum,2 and the increased rater variability observed when assessing dark skin,14 it is important to ensure that rater training materials for dermatology clinical trials are diverse and sufficiently represent all skin types. This is vital for making sure disease severity and treatment effects are accurately captured for patients of color participating in clinical research. However, although there are textbooks such as the Atlas of Black Skin19 that contain high-quality images of dermatological conditions on darker skin, there is no standardized image library for rater training that illustrates how signs manifest and progress with disease severity across different skin types. Issues with images currently used in rater training range from poor image resolution and artefacts obstructing the affected area, to limited depiction of key anatomical areas affected by disease.To address this issue, Signant Health gathered a multidisciplinary team of graphic artists, scientists, and expert clinicians to develop a set of training images for clinical research. The team developed high resolution, photo-realistic images of the different signs of atopic dermatitis across severity levels and skin types which can be seen below. These images capture the progression of the signs of atopic dermatitis in common anatomical areas affected by the condition (e.g. inside of the elbow and back of the knee), with the affected area being represented without obstruction. By using this set of images, clinicians can be trained to identify and rate otherwise difficult signs such as erythema on darker skin. Training on such a diverse set of images has the potential to increase the reliability of clinician reported measures in dermatology clinical trials.Clinical trials are essential in contemporary evidence-based medicine, as they generate evidence on the safety and efficacy of new therapies and treatments. Diversity of participants in clinical trials is critical to ensure that the trial population is representative of the patients who will be using the treatment being tested, and that the findings are generalizable. Although historically racial and ethnic minorities have been underrepresented in clinical research across therapeutic indications,20 including dermatology,21 major efforts have been made in the US by the FDA and the Revitalization Act of 1993. This has led to a steady increase of dermatological trials involving ethnic minorities.3 As such, diversity in training materials for clinicians taking part in a clinical trial, ensuring they are well positioned to judge treatment effectiveness across skin types, is critical.ReferencesLouie, P. & Wilkes, R.

              "  'D': 'From Prague to Minneapolis to Dubai, clinical trials are increasingly globalâ€”and that makes logistics, now more than ever, a mission-critical factor for conducting a successful clinical trial. However, if there are delays during the clinical trial phase, the financial impact can be staggering.While any number of factors might cause delays, from strategic challenges to commercial barriers, logistics can play a key role. Every delay, from equipment not arriving at a clinical site on time to patients unable to arrive for an onsite visit, creates an avalanche of effects, from decreased patient retention to increased timeto market.As with other aspects of clinical trials, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the logistics that fuel the supply chain. By July 2020, almost 200 companies had stopped or delayed their clinical trials because of the pandemic,1 and itâ€™s estimated that about 80% of non-COVID-19 clinical trials were interrupted or stopped.2 As the pandemic continued, with delays continuing for months, trials that were in progress were hampered as any inventory redundancies built into their supply chain eroded.The pandemicâ€”and the upheaval that came with itâ€”underscored gaps in clinical trial logistics. It also created opportunities for organizations to reimagine the process for creating more efficient, reliable, patient-centric clinical trials.Bringing clarity to future trialsBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, many sponsors and CROs had already begun to leverage digitalization to operate more efficiently and prevent costly downtime. As the need to quickly and safely develop COVID-19 vaccines and treatments emerged, organizations needed visibility into their processes as well as the full supply chain. Sponsors and CROs already using digital solutions were better positioned to make that pivot quickly because they already had real-time transparency to make strategic logistics decisions.In COVID-19â€™s wake, sponsors, CROs and their logistics partners will need to continue and even expand visibility into every logistics touch point, ensuring supply chain integrity. Along with making sure shipments meet regulatory guidelines, the â€œAmazon effectâ€\\x9d has also increased visibility expectations. Everyone along the supply chain, including clinical staff and patients, want to know not only where their supplies and equipment are, but precisely when they will arrive.In addition to the expectation for increased visibility, thereâ€™s a growing need for flexibility. Traditionally, sponsors and CROs have relied on recruiting parameters based on numerous factors, from regional patient populations to a diseaseâ€™s prevalence in the population. Predictions help organizations ensure that they are sending the right kits to the right clinical trial sites. Miscalculations can lead to oversupply at one site and shortages at another.Digitalization tools can provide the transparency needed to overcome these challenges. For example, a kit with a scannable label can be tracked across the entire supply chain, from the moment it leaves the kit assembly line to the patientâ€™s home and finally to the biorepository. Machine learning tools can take the process a step further by considering various factors, like capacity or hours of service, across multiple supply chains. Radio-frequency identification can also help manage shipments needed to service these clinical trials.These capabilities provide dynamic, multi-mode estimated time of arrival information, whether a package is delayed at a border crossing or five blocks away from a patientâ€™s home. End-to-end visibility enhances the patient experience but can also create the tracking and traceability needed to meet regulatory demands.Maintaining regulatory compliance in emerging regionsAs the COVID-19 pandemic created the need to fast-track vaccines and treatments, emerging geographies, like the BRICS block (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the Middle East, became important locations for related clinical trials. While their large, diverse populations are ideal for conducting multiple, large-scale trials in parallel, the regulatory process in these nations is still evolving. This creates a challenging regulatory landscape for logistics.From clinical trial approvals to transporting clinical supplies and medical equipment, regulations can vary greatly from country to country. Regulations for transporting clinical trial products and medical equipment can be inconsistent, making it more difficult to plan and coordinate across jurisdictions, especially if they are governed by different regulatory organizations. For example, different transportation modes within an area might require specific types of paperwork to be secured. In addition, the timelines in emerging markets can run much longer than what might be considered standard when conducting trials in many Western nations. Even in well established markets, regulations change and the supply chain needs to adjust to new regulatory standards, such as EU MDR regulation in Europe that came into effect May 2021.As clinical trials move forward, CROs and sponsors need to fully understand clinical trial regulations in every jurisdiction in which they operate. Working with local trial coordinators or partners who understand each regionâ€™s unique logistics challenges can help organizations understand regulations within all relevant jurisdictions to avoid the inadvertent violations and help trials stay on track.Managing home deliveryIn many aspects, the logistical challenges common to traditional, on-site clinical trials are also evident in those that are hybrid or virtualâ€”albeit on an exponential scale. For example, rather than delivering equipment to a dozen sites for a specific trial, a decentralized trial might require thousands of individual shipments to patientsâ€™ homes.Logistical complexity goes beyond simply making sure the right patient gets the right kit at the right time. Other factors might include coordination and pickup of biological samples from patients, or the return of equipment or perhaps materials that are partially used, unused or even expired. And extending beyond logistical complexities, data compliance regulations, such as HIPAA or GDPR, expand further back in the supply chain as partners need to handle patient data that enables home delivery of equipment as well as labeling for sample collections.Sponsors and CROs may want to consider partnering with specialized companies with the resources and experience to manage direct-to-patient shipments, no matter where the supplies or equipment is being sent. These types of partnerships can help ensure the sponsors or CROs can focus on clinical trial design and outcomes as well as patient experience.Leveraging wearable medical devicesMobile health (mHealth) is one tool helping facilitate clinical trial logistics. Two-way communication medical wearables, like smartphone apps, patches or other monitoring sensors, can measure essential biometric data. In addition to providing clinical staff with accurate, real-time health data, these devices help to reduce or eliminate the need for in-clinic visits, making it easier for trials to continue even in the face of unexpected macro events. Patients also experience a greater degree of independence because the technology reduces or eliminates the need for clinic visits, which helps increase retention. mHealth devices can reduce costs, too, by decreasing the time and expense related to in-clinic visits.Wearable medical device usage is perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of the clinical trials of the future. mHealth devices are currently in the first generation of development. As developers continue to refine the technology, it will evolve, much like the apps consumers use on smartphones. CROs able to leverage this new technology by acquiring or partnering with software companies can help move innovation forward to improve the trialâ€™s efficiency and the patientâ€™s experience.Delivering training in a decentralized clinical trialLogistics is more than the movement of people and products; itâ€™s also about the movement of information. As COVID-19 led to wider adoption of decentralized clinical trials, sponsors and CROs were prompted to find effective ways to deliver the training patients need to participate in their care. In traditional clinical trials, a recruited staff would receive any relevant training at the team level. However, hybrid and virtual trials require the delivery of that information to each individual patient.For example, clinical teams can transmit alerts to a patientsâ€™ wearable or medical device to remind the patient to conduct a test or provide a sample. An app might also deliver information, like instructions, so if the patient doesnâ€™t understand a process, they can view a step-by-step how-to guide or even contact off-site, 24/7 support.Considering additional challengesData and cybersecurity in logistics is a concern that will become more critical in the near-term. In traditional clinical trial site settings, patientsâ€™ private information is blinded from supplier, service and logistics partners. For example, a repository sample might be shipped with a patient information rendered as a code.Now, hybrid and virtual trials require partners to ship directly to or pick up directly from patients, requiring partners to have access to a range of personal information, from the patientâ€™s name and address to the study type to the serial number of the equipment used. Data that is not properly secured can create cybersecurity risks that potentially expose confidential patient information as well as violate regulatory standards.In addition to data and cybersecurity compliance with GDPR in Europe and HIPAA in the United States, sponsors, CROs and their logistics partners must navigate emerging regions where the intersection of virtual trials, data and cybersecurity is still in the early stages of development.Moving forward into opportunityNo matter how quickly the clinical trial landscape changes or where those changes lead the industry, there is one factor that will not change: expect the unexpected. There is simply no way to predict every unforeseen event. Within the last few years alone, logistics within the pharmaceutical industry, and clinical trials in particular, have been challenged with events ranging from COVID-19 to Brexit to the vessel that temporarily blocked one of the worldâ€™s busiest trade routes, the Suez Canal.The unexpected will continue to challenge organizations to maximize robust, flexible logistics that ensure supply chain integrityâ€”and those in the clinical trials space will rise to meet that challenge and leverage the opportunity it brings. Whether supplies are being shipped to a patientâ€™s home or equipment is being moved from one clinical site to another, reliable logistics is a key factor in creating an efficient and reliable patient-centric clinical trials.ReferencesAdams, B.

The products are Secura Bioâ€™s Farydak for previously treated multiple myeloma, and Aurobindo Pharmaâ€™s Marqibo indication for Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) following two or more lines of treatments.\\nIn the spring, the FDAâ€™s Oncology Center of Excellence launched an industry-wide review of accelerated approvals that havenâ€™t shown clinical benefits in confirmatory trials.

Secura bought worldwide rights to Farydak from Novartis in 2019. The drugâ€™s original FDA nod in 2015 was a hard-fought one, given that the FDAâ€™s external experts voted against its approval due to concerns about side effects. Farydak is indicated for use with Takedaâ€™s Velcade and the steroid dexamethasone.\\nThe latest data on Fradyak, released earlier this year, cameÂ\\xa0from a phase 2 trial dubbed Panorama 3. The trial tested Fradyak with a subcutaneous version of Velcade, rather than its original intravenous formulation. It showed that Fradyak, at its approved dosing strength, produced a similar response rate with the new regimen as that shown in the original Panorama 1 trial, but that it had a longer duration of response. Patients taking the combination with subcutaneous Velcade reported fewer side effects, such as severe diarrhea, than what was observedÂ\\xa0in the earlier trial.â€œ\\nIn a statement to Fierce Pharma, Secura chief medical officer David Cohan, M.D., said the company remainsÂ\\xa0â€œcommitted to working with the FDA on fulfilling all post-marketing requirements for Farydak in a timely manner.â€\\x9d\\nAs for Marqibo, that drug got its FDA go-ahead in 2012 and has since changed hands twice, first from Talon Therapeutics to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals in 2013 and then to Aurobindo in 2019. The drug earned its third-line ALL approval after a single-arm phase 2 study recorded a 15.4% complete response rate.\\nThe phase 3 Hallmarq trial in patients over 60 with newly diagnosed ALL was supposed to serve as Marqiboâ€™s confirmatory trial. The plan was to enroll 348 patients and compare Marqibo, a targeted version of chemotherapy vincristine, with standard vincristine. But Spectrum terminated the study in 2015, after recruiting justÂ\\xa026 participants over three years, according to clinicaltrials.gov.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Bristol Myers pulls an Istodax lymphoma use 10 years after FDA accelerated approval\\nThe upcoming advisory committee meeting â€œwill have a general discussion focused on next steps for each product including whether the indications should remain on the market while additional trial(s) are conducted,â€\\x9d the FDA said in a notice Friday. \\nSome pharma companies seem to be realizing that the FDA is moving its house-cleaning beyond immuno-oncology agents. And they're getting ahead of any negative decisions. Bristol Myers in August said itâ€™s withdrawing Istodaxâ€™s indication as a monotherapy for previously treated peripheral T-cell lymphoma after a recent confirmatory phase 3 trial flop in newly diagnosed patients.\\nEditor's Note: The story has been updated with a statement from Secura Bio.\\n\"},\n",

That threatened the impressive run ofÂ\\xa0Vascepa, which raked in $598 million in sales in 2020, up 40% from the prior year.Â\\xa0\\nIn a note to clients Thursday, SVB Leerink analyst Roanna Ruiz said that Amarin's salesforce cuts will force the company toÂ\\xa0widenÂ\\xa0its prescriber outreach through bolstered digital strategies, such as emails, digital content and online events.Â\\xa0\\nâ€œThese digital initiatives can be tracked by number of clicks and time spent on digital content, so Amarin can learn and adapt quickly,â€\\x9d Ruiz wrote.Â\\xa0\\nWhile the reduced headcount wasnâ€™t surprising, it did come earlier than expected, according to Leerink analysts. Amarinâ€™s total 2021 salesforce costs should now come down to roughly $164 million, a drop from the previously expected $237 million, the investment bank said.Â\\xa0\\nAfter meeting with Amarin management, Leerinkâ€™s analysts concluded that the drugmaker hopes toÂ\\xa0expand its outreach from roughly 75,000 general practitioners to as many as 250,000.

When the Biden administration announced plans to make boosters available this week, pending FDA authorization, some experts questioned whether that plan was scientifically sound. The World Health Organization griped that vaccine doses should go to unvaccinated people in developing countries before those in wealthier nations get access to boosters.\\nDuring last week's meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, several experts pointed out that the data are insufficient to support a sweeping approval. Pfizer cited the boost in antibody levels provided by a third shot, but it wasn't clear how that correlated to protection and transmission, they said. The panelists also raised questions about the safety of a booster doseâ€”especially in younger peopleâ€”and pointed to the lack of data to properly evaluate the risk.\\nAs the debate erupted last month, news emerged that two key FDA officials are preparing to leave the agency: Office of Vaccines Research and Review Director Marion Gruber, Ph.D., and Deputy Director Phillip Krause, M.D. That leaves Marks as acting director of the vaccines unit until replacements can be found.\\nWednesdayâ€™s decision on COVID-19 booster shots applies only to those who have been inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine.

Doctor feedback showed that calcineurin inhibitors lead the steroid-refractory space with 34% of market share, followed by Jakafi at 15%. In the third-to-fifth lines, Jakafi ranked either firstÂ\\xa0or second in market share at each line of treatment. \\nAltogether, 92% of surveyed doctors said they will mostly use Jakafi for second- and third-line treatment of chronic GVHD, the analysts wrote.\\n\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Kadmon eyes $15.5K price tag and August debut for new transplant rejection med Rezurock\\nMeanwhile, pharma giant Sanofi just boughtÂ\\xa0an approved asset inÂ\\xa0the increasinglyÂ\\xa0fragmented chronic GVHD market with its $1.9 billion purchase of Kadmon.

That means the ROCK inhibitor will likely be used after failure of Jakafi, Amin observed.\\nThe FDA evaluatedÂ\\xa0Jakafiâ€™s latest applicationÂ\\xa0under Project Orbis, which allows for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international regulators. In addition to GVHD, Jakafi is also approved for certain blood cancers.\\n\\nThough a nice addition, Jakafiâ€™s latest label expansion is of less importance to Incyte than the atopic dermatitis approval for its sister med Opzelura, or ruxolitinib cream.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Incyte's Jakafi sister med clears FDA for atopic dermatitis, but safety warning a heavy cross to bear\\n\\nWhile Jakafi dodged a bullet amid FDAâ€™s increased scrutiny overÂ\\xa0JAK inhibitor safety, Opzelura suffered collateral damage with a class-wide boxed warning on its label. In her Thursday note, Young said the box warning will add skepticism and make uptake more challenging. Â\\xa0\\nIncyte has projected a peak sales of $1.5 billion for Opzelura, in line with Wall Streetâ€™s consensus 2030 estimates.

And the French pharma spent less than three months to successfully convince the biotech of that and to find the right price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom June 26 to Sept. 7, in what was a whirlwind of transaction discussions, Sanofi turned an original collaboration outreach into an outright acquisition, just as Kadmon attracted interest from two other potential buyers and managed to sell itself at a better price, a Kadmon securities filing (PDF) shows.\\nSanofi made the first move. Matthieu Merlin, Sanofiâ€™s head of business development and licensing at its general medicines business unit contacted Kadmon on June 26 for an introductory call to explore collaboration opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMerlinâ€™s communication came on the heels of a similar request for an introduction by another company, coded Party A, to Kadmonâ€™s financial service provider Moelis. Kadmon CEO Harlan Waksal and chief financial officer Steven Meehan held a conference call with representatives from Party A on July 8, where the two sides covered topics including potential benefits of a collaboration or other strategic transaction.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0On a dealmaking roll, Sanofi lays out $1.9B for Kadmon and its newly launched transplant drug\\nOn July 12, Merlin talked to Kadmonâ€™s general counsel Gregory Moss and expressed Sanofiâ€™s interest in Rezurock. Little did they know at the time that the ROCK inhibitor would go on and snag a quick FDA go-ahead for third-line treatment of chronic GVHD just four days afterward and six weeks ahead of schedule.\\nOn July 20, Merlin contacted Moss again. This time, he brought news that Sanofi may be interested in a larger transaction covering the entire company, including its immuno-oncology platform. \\nSanofi dispatched its higher-level execs to their nextâ€”and in-personâ€”meeting on July 27. Besides Merlin and Moss, Sanofiâ€™s chief financial officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, head of general medicines Olivier Charmeil and global head of mergers andÂ\\xa0acquisitions Loic Gonnet joined Kadmonâ€™s Waksal and its senior vice president of research and nonclinical development Jeegar Patel. In a post-meeting dinner, the Sanofi execs confirmed its interest in acquiring Kadmon.\\nMeanwhile, Kadmon hadÂ\\xa0entered a confidentiality agreement with standstill provisions with Party A, whichÂ\\xa0during a meeting at its European headquarters on July 28, indicated that it was also interested in acquiring the New York biotech.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Kadmon eyes $15.5K price tag and August debut for new transplant rejection med Rezurock\\nAt this point, Kadmon remembered another potential bidder, Party B, which had previously also suggested that it was looking for deals once Rezurock cleared the FDA. Kadmon noted to Party B that it was now open to deal talks on July 29.\\nFollowing a Kadmon board meeting, Sanofi and Party A would learn on Aug. 4 that the biotech now had formal authorization to conduct full-on sale discussions. It was on that day that Sanofi made its first offer to buy Kadmon at $7 per share, or a 55% premium to its prior closing price. \\nKadmon immediately rejected that term. Five days later, Sanofi sent over its second bid of $9 per Kadmon share alongside a request for exclusive negotiations. And Kadmon turned away that offer again but granted Sanofi further access to the companyâ€™s confidential information to conduct its due diligence.\\nIn the meantime, discussions with Party A and Party B hit dead ends. On Aug. 18, Party A told Kadmon that it was no longer in the game thanks to Rezurockâ€™s anticipated regulatory timeline in Europe. As for Party B, Kadmonâ€™s board noted during a meeting on Aug. 23 that that third firm was significantly behind in conducting due diligence and that it wasnâ€™t in a position to make an offer. In addition, none of the six other companies that Kadmonâ€™s financial advisers reached out to expressed meaningful interest in a merger, according to the securities filing.\\nIn between those time points, on Aug. 21, Sanofi came back with its third and â€œfinal proffer,â€\\x9d proposing to take over Kadmon at $9.5 apiece, which marked an 88% premium to the companyâ€™s previous closing price. Based on the progress with Party A and Party B, Kadmon entered the exclusivity agreement with Sanofi.\\nAfter several back-and-forth discussions around termination fees, Rezurockâ€™s upstream licensesÂ\\xa0plus other deal terms, Kadmon and Sanofi finally shook hands on Sept. 7 before making the deal public the next day.Â\\xa0The final deal had Sanofi paying $1.9 billion for Kadmon and newly approvedÂ\\xa0Rezurock, which complements the French pharma's existing transplant meds, Mozobil and Thymoglobulin.

Some of the items are theoretical problems for the cream, as they have so far turned up in oral JAK inhibitors, while otherÂ\\xa0issues reflect observations from JAKs for inflammatory conditions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncyte had previously expected a relatively clean label for Opzelura despite increased FDA scrutiny on the entire JAK inhibitor class. Jakafi, the oral formulation of ruxolitinib, treats blood cancer and transplant rejectionÂ\\xa0and was spared from the label restrictions the FDA recently added to oral JAKs treating inflammatory diseases.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Incyte hits 2nd FDA delay in span of days, this time for atopic dermatitis hopeful ruxolitinibÂ\\xa0cream\\nDespite the boxed warnings, Incyte expects Opzelura could reach at least $1.5 billion in peak sales,Â\\xa0Todd Edwards, the companyâ€™s head of inflammation and autoimmunity business unit, told investors during a call Wednesday. The calculation comes from an estimate that patients will use about three to four tubes of 60-mgÂ\\xa0Opzelura a year at a per-unit wholesale acquisition cost of $1,950.\\nWall Street pegged Opzelura to reach $1.5 billion in sales by 2030, but SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens figured the number is too high, putting his estimates at $600 million by 2030. Â\\xa0\\nFor his part, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams marked $550 million for the drugâ€™s peak U.S. sales for atopic dermatitis. In a Tuesday note to clients, he stressed that payer formulary position â€œwill be critical for gauging ultimate revenue potential.â€\\x9d In a survey Abrahamsâ€™ team did in February, 36% of 40 dermatologists said they view reimbursement as the biggest hurdle to the use of atopic dermatitis therapies.\\nAnalysts in general are having a hard time pinning a definite answer to how Opzelura might perform. On the one hand, the black box could be a serious blow; RBCâ€™s physician survey showed that a similar warning for Opzelura as the oral JAKs could cut the creamâ€™s adoption by 33%. The RBC team argued the reduction would mostly affect the mild patient population. Before the FDAâ€™s safety review of oral JAKs, Incyteâ€™s own physician survey found 85% ofÂ\\xa0dermatologistsÂ\\xa0indicated they would likely giveÂ\\xa0Opzelura to their patients. A more recent survey by the company suggested dermatologists would reduce use by 15% in the case of a boxed warning.\\nWhatâ€™s more, poor commercial performance of other branded topical eczema drugs such as Pfizerâ€™s once blockbuster hopeful Eucrisa doesnâ€™t really offer pharma watchers confidence in Opzelura. Cheap, generic topical corticosteroids are widely used for eczema.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0JAK inhibitors from Pfizer, AbbVie and Lilly hit with dreaded FDA heart safety, cancer warnings\\nBut on the other hand, physicians expressed enthusiasm for Opzelura given its strong efficacy and lack of topical options. In its two phase 3 TRuE-AD trials, twice-daily Opzelura helped significantly more patients achieve clearer skin and reduce itch compared to nonmedicated cream. After eight weeks of treatment, 53.8% of Opzelura takers in TRuE-AD1 and 51.3% in TRuE-AD2 enjoyed clear or almost clear skins, versus 15.1% and 7.6% for the control patients in the two trials, respectively.\\nThe recent boxed warnings the FDA slapped on the labels of Pfizerâ€™s Xeljanz, AbbVieâ€™s Rinvoq and Eli Lillyâ€™s Olumiant indicate the agencyâ€™s cautionary stance on the three oral JAK inhibitors, which came after a large postmarketing study for Xeljanz in rheumatoid arthritis noted safety signals. While the FDA dug into findings from the Xeljanz study, the agency had delayed its decisions on OpzeluraÂ\\xa0as well as atopic dermatitis rulings for Rinvoq, Olumiant and Pfizerâ€™s investigational abrocitinib.\\nAbrahams, in his February note, suggested the oral JAKs â€œappeared to have more of a potential role in severe patients who would otherwise receive biologics,â€\\x9d while Opzelura could become â€œthe preferred agentâ€\\x9d in moderate disease.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Despite JAK 'anxiety,' ICER experts overwhelmingly back Incyte's ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis\\nOpzelura is broadly viewed as Incyteâ€™s key program to diversify away from Jakafi before the oral med falls off the patent cliff in 2027, Evercore ISI analysts noted in their analysis Tuesday. Jakafiâ€™s revenues of $529 million made up 76% of Incyteâ€™s total haul in the second quarter. Now, with Opzeluraâ€™s boxed warnings, Incyte will likely turn to striking deals, the analysts said.\\nIn addition to atopic dermatitis, Opzelura recently hit its goal in two phase 3 trials in vitiligo. For eczema, Opzelura is currently indicated for â€œshort-term and noncontinuous chronic treatment,â€\\x9d but the Evercore ISI team pointed out that vitiligo requires more chronic treatment. During Wednesdayâ€™sÂ\\xa0call, IncyteÂ\\xa0said the intermittent dosing description is only reflecting the eczema clinical trial design and that it expects a potential vitiligo indication to have its own dosing.\\n\\n\"},\n",

In the first half of the 2021, sales declined 5% in part thanks to lower prices, but the drug â€œcontinued to maintain first-line share leadership in psoriasis,â€\\x9d the company said.\\nRELATED: Under-pressure Amgen insists Otezla can withstand Bristol Myers' forthcoming psoriasis rival\\nWhile it appears Amgen won't have to worry about generics right away, the company's key med could face forthcoming competition from Bristol Myers Squibb's TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib, an oral med that has outperformed Otezla in head-to-head trials. Even amid that potential competition, Amgen and analysts believe the company can still succeed in mild to moderate patients.\\n\"},\n",

However, the improvement failed to meet the statistical significance bar. The results were published at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2021 virtual meeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPatients with PD-L1 scores of at least 20 lived a median 17.6 months while on Opdivo-Yervoy, versus 14.6 months for EXTREME, results from the CheckMate-651 trial showed.\\nRELATED: Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo and Yervoy combo falls short in first-line squamous head and neck cancer\\nDuring an interview, BMSâ€™ head of oncology development, Jonathan Cheng, noted that patients in the EXTREME group performed better than expected, which he attributed to a high rate of subsequent use of immunotherapy after disease progression. To be specific, 46% patients in the EXTREME arm and 8% in the Opdivo-Yervoy arm received subsequent immunotherapy.\\nPreviously in Keytrudaâ€™s Keynote-048 trialâ€”which in 2019 earned the Merck PD-1 drug two simultaneous FDA go-aheads in front-line recurrent or metastatic SCCHNâ€”Keytruda monotherapy cut the risk of death by 39% and a Keytruda-chemo combo the same risk by 40% over EXTREME in patients with PD-L1 levels at 20 or above. The median overall survival lengths among those patients were 14.9 months for Keytruda monotherapy, 14.7 months for Keytruda-chemo, and 10.7 months for chemo alone.\\nâ€œWe do think itâ€™s not uncommon in oncology for the standard of care to continue to improve as time goes on with better supportive care and better treatments,â€\\x9d Cheng said. â€œIn this case particularly, subsequent therapy clearly has a large impact as the checkpoint inhibitors â€¦ get more and more used in later lines of therapy.â€\\x9d\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0BMS' head and neck cancer hopes take a hit with Opdivo-Yervoy trial flop\\nCheng declined to comment on BMSâ€™ regulatory plan but said that investigators and other physicians whoâ€™ve tried this regimen are â€œenthusiastic about the potential benefit of checkpoint inhibitors,â€\\x9d including the Opdivo-Yervoy combo, for head and neck cancer patients. The immunotherapy doublet has previouslyÂ\\xa0failed to top Opdivo monotherapyÂ\\xa0in previously treated patients.\\nAs for a strategy for coping with this continued outperformance of a control arm, Cheng said the power of immuno-oncology agents as later-line treatments must be taken into account in study designs. â€œOne just has to acknowledge that and be able to predict what the improvement of standard of care might be moving forwardâ€\\x9d and plan appropriately, he said. \\nCheng also suggested that measuring tumor progression might be of increasing value. In CheckMate-651, patients with PD-L1 scores of at least 20 were at similar riskÂ\\xa0of disease progression for Opdivo-Yervoy and EXTREME; in fact, the median progression-free survival for the BMS therapy was shorter at 5.4 months, versus 7 months for EXTREME.

Pfizer and Merck KGaAâ€™s PD-L1 inhibitor Bavencio, used alongside Erbitux-containing standard treatment, failed to show a survival advantage in locally advanced SCCHN.\\nIn the Gortec-Reach trial, the Bavencio regimen showed a favorableâ€”but not statistically significantâ€”trend toward staving off tumor progression in patients who were unfit to receive the chemotherapy cisplatin. And the two-year overall survival rates were similar between the two groups at 58% for Bavencio and 54% for control. As for the cisplatin-fit cohort, progression-free survival instead favored standard of care over Bavencio.\\nThe Erbitux combo trial flop followed Pfizer and Merck KGaAâ€™s own Javelin Head and Neck 100 defeat, where Bavencio was paired with just chemoradiotherapy.

And now,Â\\xa0they've turned up competitive data that could pressure entrenched players Merck & Co. and Bristol Myers Squibb.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLibtayo, used on top of platinum doublet chemotherapy, reduced the risk of death by 29% over chemo alone in patients with previously untreated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, according to data released at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2021 virtual congress. \\nThe 29% improvement in patient survival may not seem so impressive, especially after Keytruda put up aÂ\\xa0massive 51% risk reduction. But a closer look at the results as offered by Regeneron and Sanofi could give rivals Merck and Bristol Myers pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe phase 3 Empower-Lung 3 trial included both squamous (43%) and nonsquamous (57%) NSCLC patients, all without actionable mutations. The Libtayo-chemo combo extended patient survival to a median 21.9 months, versus 13 months for the solo chemo group.\\nDifficult comparison looks good for Libtayo\\nBy contrast, in Keytrudaâ€™s historic Keynote-189 trial, where the Merck PD-1 posted the 51% death risk reduction at an interim analysis, Keytruda and chemo prolonged survival for nonsquamous patients to about 22 months, whereas the control group recorded 10.6 months at final analysis. Then, in the Keynote-407 trial, squamous patients who took Keytruda and chemo lived a median 15.9 months, compared with 11.3 months for solo chemo, leading to a death risk reduction of 36% at interim.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Sanofi, Regeneron stop Libtayo-chemo lung cancer trial early on strong survival data\\nNotice the difference? Libtayoâ€™s overall survival showing across disease subtypes looked very similar to Keytrudaâ€™s at its best in the nonsquamous group, and the chemo arm appeared to have performed betterÂ\\xa0in Empower-Lung 3 than in the Keytruda trials.\\nRegeneron entered the study expecting to see about 12 months of median overall survival for the chemo group,Â\\xa0Israel Lowy, senior VP of translational and clinical sciences of oncology at Regeneron, told Fierce Pharma in an interview.\\nStill, one can't conclude that Libtayo is necessarily better than Keytruda, because there's an importantÂ\\xa0difference between the studies: Empower-Lung 3 enrolled both advanced (stage 3) and metastatic (stage 4) patients, while the Keytruda trials only included stage 4 disease. In the Libtayo trial, 15% of patients had inoperable locally advanced disease not eligible for definitive chemoradiation.\\nBut Lowy argued that includingÂ\\xa0thoseÂ\\xa0earlier-stage patients didnâ€™t push up Libtayoâ€™s survival performance. According to him, advanced patients who arenâ€™t eligible for surgery or chemoradiation have large tumor masses, so they donâ€™t necessarilyÂ\\xa0do better than patients with small metastases. He did notice, however, that relative to the nonsquamous population, the squamous group appeared to have done better for LibtayoÂ\\xa0compared with results seen in other trials.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Sanofi, Regeneron's Libtayo snags lung cancer nod, taking a stab at Keytruda's megablockbuster lead\\nA more straightforward comparison could be made with Opdivo, whose use alongside Bristolâ€™s CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy and chemo snagged their front-line NSCLC approval last May. \\nIn the CheckMate 9LA trial, the Opdivo-Yervoy-chemo cocktail cut patientsâ€™ risk of death by 31% over chemo. Patients with recurrent or stage 4 disease who took the Bristol regimen lived a median 14.1 months, versus 10.7 months for chemo at an interim analysis. The trial also recruited both squamous (31%) and nonsquamous (69%) subtypes.\\nOne weak point for Libtayo-chemo lies in the PD-L1-negative group. In a subgroup analysis, patients with PD-L1 expression below 1%, who make up about one-third of the total trial population, performed similarly between the Libtayo regimen and solo chemoÂ\\xa0in terms of overall survival. Although the trial isnâ€™t powered to statistically perform that analysis, the number could spell trouble for Libtayo potentially for PD-L1 nonexpressers. (Graphic for subgroup analysis can be found at the bottom of the article)\\nThe Libtayo trial used a different companion diagnostic (SP263) than in the Keynote trials,Â\\xa0Petra Rietschel, M.D., Ph.D., Regeneronâ€™s executive director of immuno-oncology clinical development, wrote in a post on ESMOâ€™s online platform during Libtayoâ€™s presentation. â€œThe difference in results might be due to SP263Â\\xa0being more sensitive and identifying a truly negative subset,â€\\x9d she wrote.\\nCross-trial comparisons can be difficult, given different trial designs. But the new data at least showed Libtayo can be competitive in front-line NSCLC. With the 22-month overall survival data, Regeneronâ€™s â€œsales reps will have plenty of firepower when detailing Libtayo as a viable anti-PD-1 option in 1L NSCLC,â€\\x9d Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in an August note to investors.\\nIt takes more than data\\nBut as Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer noted in an August report, â€œit will take more than clinical data alone to gain a foothold in 1L NSCLC.â€\\x9d He didnâ€™t yet see a niche market for Libtayo but said he would keep an eye on the companiesâ€™ commercialization plans, including potential discounting.\\nThanks to an FDA nod in February, Libtayo monotherapy is already allowed forÂ\\xa0front-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 expressionâ€”50% or more. ThatÂ\\xa0population, according to Lowy, makes up about 30% of the NSCLC pool.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0WCLC: With Keytruda-Yervoy data, Merck casts doubt on Opdivo's place in lung cancer\\nâ€œWeâ€™re under no illusion that weâ€™re suddenly going to take over the market,â€\\x9d Lowy said.Â\\xa0â€œBut we do believe that when one looks across different agents and you ask yourself the question of which one of these have delivered consistent results again and again with either monotherapy or chemo combination, weâ€™re one of only two agents that have done that.â€\\x9d\\nKeytruda is the other PD-1/L1 that also succeeded as a monotherapy in PD-L1-high NSCLC.\\n\\nLibtayoâ€™s launch in lung cancer is progressing well, according to Regeneron. â€œLung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayoâ€™s clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression,â€\\x9d Regeneronâ€™s commercial chief Marion McCourt said during a conference call in early August.\\nTheÂ\\xa0Empower-Lung 3 trial also has a second part that pairs Libtayo with Yervoy and chemo in patients with PD-L1 expression at lower than 50%. Lowy said the company started the trial amid a general excitement over CTLA-4 inhibitors'Â\\xa0potential boosting effect on PD-1 blockade.\\nBut as data mature, â€œif you have a good anti-PD1 plus standard chemotherapy, itâ€™s hard to convince yourself that combinations including CTLA-4 to date really do better than that, and it sometimes comes with the cost of additional toxicities associated with CTLA-4,â€\\x9d he said. So the company has stopped that cohort early, pending readout, and doesnâ€™t plan to seek regulatory approvals with it, he added.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Lower Libtayo's price before Chinese PD-1s do, says analyst in open letter to Regeneron CEO\\nMore competitors are on the horizon.

But, given that cancer patients were excluded from the studies, questions swirled over how well the shots would work in that group, especially for those on immunosuppressants.Â\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, a set of studies released at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2021 virtual congress are painting a clearer picture: The vaccinesâ€”particularly Pfizerâ€™s BioNTech-partnered two-jab Comirnatyâ€”are effective and safe for cancer patients, although some may benefit from an additional booster dose.Â\\xa0\\nIn one multicenter study from the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, researchers included vaccinated and unvaccinated cancer patients both on and off active therapy.Â\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nItâ€™s thought that those treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, could impact the immune system and make the vaccines less effective, although the jabs are likely safe, according to the American Cancer Society. Just last month, the FDA approved an additional, or third, mRNA dose for those with weakened immune systems, which includes cancer patients using the immune-tampering therapies.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: As Pfizer's booster AdComm nears, FDA staffers say COVID vaccines are already working as intended\\nIn the VA study, veterans with a solid or hematologic malignancy who received systemic cancer-directed therapy at least once since late 2010 were examined. The trial included an equal 29,152 vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in each arm.Â\\xa0\\nWith a median follow-up of 47 days, overall vaccine efficacyÂ\\xa0was 58% two weeks following theÂ\\xa0second dose, according to the study. Specifically, patients who were on chemotherapy within the three months prior to their first dose showed a 57% efficacy. That figure shot up to 75% for those off systemic therapy for at least six months prior.Â\\xa0\\nRead: The vaccines are an â€œan effective strategy for preventing COVID-19 in cancer patients,â€\\x9d although that may be muddied when it comes to patients on immunosuppressive therapies. Researchers suggested doing future trials to determine whether patients would benefit from booster shots or post-vaccination serology testing.Â\\xa0\\nThose results were similar to another study shared during ESMO, which found that the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA jab specifically was nearly as effective and safe in cancer patients when compared with the general population.Â\\xa0\\nThe findings were part of a subgroup analysis from Pfizerâ€™s global phase 3 studies, which included patients with cancer history, either ongoing or not. The most common solid cancers were breast, prostate and melanoma among more than 1,600 patients not on active immunosuppressive treatment.Â\\xa0\\nPfizerâ€™s vaccine was 89.7% effective for patients aged 12 and older, with three COVID-19 cases reported in the vaccine arm and 27 reported among placebo recipients two weeks after their second dose.Â\\xa0\\nThat â€œcompares favorablyâ€\\x9d with Pfizerâ€™s overall vaccine efficacy of 91.1%, researchers determined. While the shot did bring along more side effects than placebo, the most common reports were injection site pain and fatigue.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: ASCO and Friends push for more cancer patients in COVID-19 vaccine trials\\nIsrael, which has already started vaccinating cancer patients with Pfizerâ€™s vaccine since January, has largely served as a barometer for the U.S.â€™s own vaccination efforts.

              "  'D': \"Pharma watchers have always suspected that AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyoâ€™s Enhertu is a better HER2 therapy than Rocheâ€™s Kadcyla. But guessing is all they could do without a head-to-head trial to showÂ\\xa0just how different the two antibody-drug conjugates are.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnhertu slashed the risk of disease progression or death by a massive 71.6% over Kadcyla in second-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with Rocheâ€™s Herceptin and chemo, AstraZeneca and Daiichi reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2021 virtual meeting.\\nThe showing is so impressive that the study authors concluded that the study, dubbed Destiny-Breast03, will lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Jefferies analysts recently pegged Enhertuâ€™s peak sales in the second-lineÂ\\xa0setting at $500 million.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnhertu showed superior benefits on several fronts in the trial. The median time to disease progression or death was not reached for Enhertu and 6.8 months for Kadcyla, according to a blinded independent review, which led to the aboveÂ\\xa071.6% progression-free survival edge. By investigatorâ€™s analysis, the median time to progression or death was 25.1 months for EnhertuÂ\\xa0versus 7.2 months for Kadcyla, and there was a risk reduction of 73.5%.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0The top 10 antibody drug conjugate contenders in 2021 | 2. Daiichi Sankyo | 4. Roche\\nKadcyla appeared to showÂ\\xa0an inferior efficacy profile compared with its historical clinical results. In its own phase 3 Emilia trial among second-line patients, Kadcyla recorded a progression-free survival of 9.6 months.\\nKadcyla did seem to have underperformed in some patients, Dave Fredrickson, AstraZenecaâ€™s head of oncology business unit, acknowledged in an interview, but he pointed out that the Emilia trial was run at a time when Rocheâ€™s Perjeta wasnâ€™t approved for the postsurgery treatment of patients with early breast cancer. So those patients didnâ€™t have the big upfront impact from early treatment with Perjeta. In the post-Perjeta as adjuvant era, Kadcylaâ€™s performance is largely in line with real-world experience, he said.\\nIn Destiny-Breast03, Enhertu also more than doubled the number of patients who responded to treatment, as the AZ-Daiichi med shrunk tumors in about 8 of 10 its patients, while the rate for Kadcyla was just a little over one third.\\nâ€œThe investigators that we talked to start talking about maybe weâ€™re opening up the possibility for some women that a cure could be possible in advance disease,â€\\x9d Fredrickson said.\\nThe life extension data remain immature; Enhertu cut the risk of death by 44.5% at the interim analysis, though it hasnâ€™t met the statistical significance bar. The estimated 12-month survival rate was 94.1% for EnhertuÂ\\xa0versus 85.9% for Kadcyla.Â\\xa0\\nDecreasing interstitial lung disease rate 'very encouraging'\\nBeyond the unquestionable efficacy win, industry watchers have been keeping a close eye on the potentially dangerous side effect of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which has appeared at higher rates in drugs developed with Daiichiâ€™s antibody-drug conjugate technology. Doctors often cite the safety signal as a key reason why they arenâ€™t already prescribingÂ\\xa0Enhertu in the FDA-approved third-line breast cancer setting. \\nHere, Fredrickson described Enhertuâ€™s safety profile as â€œvery encouraging.â€\\x9d ILD turned up in 10.5% of Enhertu patients, none in the severe grade 4 or 5 groups. For Kadcyla, the problem occurred in 1.9% of patients, all belonging to grade 1 or 2. Previously, the Destiny-Breast01 trial in late-line disease linked Enhertu to a 13.6% ILD rate, including 2.2% of deaths.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo launch Enhertu head-to-head trial with eyes on a new breast cancer standard\\nLower overall ILD rate and no patient deaths are improvements for Enhertu, but two breast cancer experts had previously told SVB Leerink that Enhertuâ€™s ILD rate needs to come in along the lines of 5% to significantly penetrate the front- or second-line breast cancer settings.\\nFredrickson argued that physicians are mainly focused on grade 4 or 5 ILD event, because â€œthere is an acceptance that grade 1/ 2 ILD is something that is manageable.â€\\x9d AZ has invested in awareness, monitoring and management of ILD, he added, and the rates in the real-world appear to be â€œmuch lowerâ€\\x9d as a result of those efforts.\\nAZ and Daiichi have recently moved Enhertu into a front-line HER2-positive breast cancer trial and are exploring the ADC in a range of disease areas. These include the Destiny-Breast 04 trial in second-line HER2-low breast cancer, which expects to read out in the first half of 2022.\\nAdding new stomach cancer, lung cancer data\\nAlso at ESMO 2021, the pair unveiled data from the single-arm Destiny-Gastric02 trial of Enhertu in Western patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Among patients who received one or two prior lines of therapy, Enhertu triggered a response in 38% of patients, lasting a median 8.1 months. \\nThe numbers were slightly weaker than in the pivotal Destiny-Gastric01 trial in Japan and South Korea that earned Enhertu its FDA go-ahead in previously treated stomach cancer in January. There, the drug spurred a response in 43% of patients, with a median duration of 11.3 months among a group of patients who had received a median two previous therapies for advanced disease. \\nThe prevalence of stomach cancer and how itâ€™s treated are different between Asian populations and in the West, Fredrickson explained. AstraZeneca said the two trials complement each other and â€œwill support ongoing discussions with global health authorities.â€\\x9d\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0ESMO: Daiichi unveils first early peek at next-gen ADC as analysts see strong data against rivals\\nIn addition, Enhertu also reported at ESMO 2021 more data from the phase 2 Destiny-Lung01 trial. After a median follow-up of 13.1 months, Enhertu shrunk tumors in 54.9% of patients with HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer who had received a median twoÂ\\xa0prior cancer therapies.\\nProbably because these patients already suffered from lung disease, the rate of ILD was high at 26.4% in the trial, including 6.6% at grade 3 or above.\\nCombined with the latest data with the positive readout reported earlier from the HER2-overexpressing cohort of the study, AZ and Daiichi are talking to regulators about a path forward for Enhertu in NSCLC, Fredrickson said.\\n\"},\n",

The phase 3 win is also important because Kisqali extended the time patients lived by over a year, the study's lead investigator, Gabriel Hortobagyi, M.D. of the MD Anderson Cancer Center, noted during an interview. \\nPatients who took Kisqali lived a median 63.9 months, compared with 51.4 months for those on Femara alone. At the six-year mark, 44.2% of Kisqali takers were still alive, versus 32% in the control group. Kisqali also pared down the risk for first next-line chemotherapy use by 26%.\\nShowing a statistically significant extension in survival for first-line breast cancer therapy is difficult, Hortobagyi explained in a statement, â€œbecause due to the development of resistance, patients receive four to 15 different types of treatment over the course of their disease and these dilute the effect of the first therapy.â€\\x9d\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0SABCS: Novartis touts Kisqali's 5-year breast cancer survival, advantage over Pfizer's Ibrance\\nThe MONALEESA-2 trial at hand marks the third time a survival advantage has been reported for Kisqali in a late-stage study. The MONALEESA-3 trial returned a 28% reduction in the risk of death for the combination of Kisqali and AstraZenecaâ€™s selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) Faslodex over solo Faslodex in a group of front- and second-line postmenopausal patients. The pairing of Kisqali and endocrine therapy demonstrated a 29% reduction of death in premenopausal women.\\nâ€œItâ€™s important to create the evidence for Kisqaliâ€™s benefit no matter which patient population, whether itâ€™s first- or second-line setting, no matter which combination partner in terms of endocrine therapy; the data are very significant [and] set a new standard of care in metastatic breast cancer,â€\\x9d Myriam Mendila, head of medical at Novartisâ€™ oncology department, said in a separate interview.\\nKisqali versusÂ\\xa0Ibrance\\n\\nWhile MONALEESA-2 is the most important Kisqali readout to date, â€œputting the three MONALEESA studies together provides a very powerful image of what this particular CDK4/6 inhibitor can achieve,â€\\x9d Hortobagyi said.\\nBut sales figures show a different story. Since the survival readout from MONALEESA-3 in the fall of 2019, Kisqaliâ€™s sales growth, especially in the U.S., didnâ€™t really match the drugâ€™s transformative nature the company has touted. In the second quarter, sales of Kisqali in the U.S. only came in at $83 million. While a recovery from a COVID-related slowdown in the first quarter, it wasnâ€™t that different from the $79 million recorded for the same period in 2020.\\nRLEATED:Â\\xa0Pfizer's Ibrance, under threat from Novartis and Lilly, leans on real-world data in breast cancer\\nBy comparison, Pfizerâ€™s first-to-market CDK inhibitor Ibrance pulled in U.S. sales of $862 million in the second quarter. Though the number was down 7% year over yearâ€”which Pfizer blamed on more patient assistance program enrolleesâ€”the drug still maintained a huge lead, with 73% share, in first-line new patient starts.\\nIbrance achieved that solid performance despite having flopped several late-stage trials, and the phase 2 PALOMA-1 trial for the Ibrance-Femara combo also failed to show a significant overall survival advantage. \\nIbrance has enjoyed leader status because it entered the market one year ahead of Kisqali, and thatâ€™s a big advantage as physicians have gotten used to prescribing it, Hortobagyi explained. He pointed to the example of aromatase inhibitors, noting that even though many consider Femara a better drug, AstraZenecaâ€™s Arimidex remains the most prescribed among three available options because it came to market first.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0ESMO: Lilly's Verzenio pressures Pfizer with practice-changing win in early breast cancer\\nTo Hortobagyi, a key junction that could tip the balance between the two drugs may come from the PALOMA-2 trial, which tests the Pfizer drug in the same setting as MONALEESA-2. The Ibrance trial still hasnâ€™t shown a clear overall survival signal despite having started a year earlier than the current Kisqali trial, Hortobagyi noted.\\nâ€œIf that [Paloma-2] trial is similarly positive to MONALEESA-2, then I think physicians will continue to prefer [Ibrance] simply because thatâ€™s their habit,â€\\x9d Hortobagyi said. â€œIfÂ\\xa0that trial is negative, then I think â€¦ there will be an exodus from [Ibrance] to [Kisqali].â€\\x9d\\nOther competitors and potential collaborators\\n\\nThereâ€™s also a third CDK4/6 inhibitor in play, Eli Lillyâ€™s Verzenio, which has also struggled to meaningfully shake Ibranceâ€™s leadership. Last year, Verzenio reported first-in-class data from the monarchE trial, showing its use after surgery could prevent cancer from returning over standard endocrine therapy in high-risk HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer. Ibrance failed in that adjuvant setting in two separate trials.\\nKisqaliâ€™s own adjuvant trial, Natalee, includes both intermediate- and high-risk patients. The trial could read out data toward the end of 2022, Mendila said.\\nRELATED: ASCO: Sanofi says early amcenestrant data could see it be 'endocrine backbone therapy' in breast cancer\\nIn addition, an emerging class of CDK7 inhibitors with players like Carrick Therapeutics also looks to take a piece of the HR-positive, HER-negative breast cancer market. Meanwhile, several companies, including Roche and Sanofi, are developing next-generation oral SERDs. Hoping to at least replace injectable SERDs like Faslodex, the oral contenders have been pairing their offerings with Ibrance. \\nMendila pointed out that none of the oral SERDs have had definite late-stage readouts, but the Swiss pharma is keeping an open mind. \\nâ€œWeâ€™re definitely excited and interested in that new class of oral SERDS,â€\\x9d Mendila said. â€œWe are also interested in collaborations and are exploring those because we believe Kisqali would be a great combination partner for oral SERD.â€\\x9d \\n\"},\n",

With an FDA go-ahead for a niche lung cancer drug, the Japanese pharma has finally scored a regulatory win and has its chance to challenge Johnson & Johnson.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe FDA granted conditional approval to Takedaâ€™s Exkivity, or mobocertinib, for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, the company said Wednesday. \\nEGFR exon 20 disease makes up 1% to 2% of all NSCLC cases, or about 2,000 to 4,000 patients per year in the U.S., Dion Warren, Takedaâ€™s head of the company's U.S. oncology business unit, said in an interview ahead of the approval. Takeda has projected peak sales of $300 million to $600 million for the medicine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEGFR exon 20-mutated NSCLC patients typically respond poorly to other EGFR inhibitors such as AstraZenecaâ€™s Tagrisso as those drugs arenâ€™t specifically designed to target this disease subtype. It was only in May that Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s bispecific antibody Rybrevant became the first FDA-approved drug for the patient group.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Johnson & Johnson snares FDA nod for first exon 20-targeted drug in EGFR lung cancer\\nFor a rare cancer type that didnâ€™t have effective targeted therapies until recently, Takedaâ€™s initial marketing strategy focuses on driving accurate diagnosis and physician education, Warren said. Diagnosis can be a challenge, and increasing awareness for this patient population takes time, he acknowledged. Exkivity represents Takedaâ€™s second targeted lung cancer drug, coming after Alunbrig for ALK-positive disease. Thanks to that prior launch, the company can at least spare the trouble of building a physicianÂ\\xa0network from scratch.\\nAlongside the Exkivity nod, the FDA has simultaneously approved an NGS companion diagnostic by Thermo Fisher, which Takeda said can enable more accurate diagnoses than PCR testing.\\nBesides Takeda's efforts to find patients, the company'sÂ\\xa0new drug alsoÂ\\xa0needs to compete with J&J's Rybrevant. By looking atÂ\\xa0early tumor shrinkage data, the Takeda drug appears to be the underdog. \\nIn a phase 1/2 trial, Exkivity triggered a response in 28% of post-chemo EGFR exon 20 insertion patients by analysis of an independent data review committee, or 35% by investigator evaluation, according to an update in February. By comparison, Rybrevant has reported a response rate of 40% in its own early-stage trial.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Not waving but drowning: Takeda's blood cancer drug flunks phase 3, dealing further blow to hopes of approval flurry\\nDuring the interview, Takedaâ€™s head of oncology global medical affairs, Awny Farajallah, M.D., pointed to Exkivityâ€™s duration of response as oneÂ\\xa0data point that stands out in favor of the med. Patients on the Takeda drug experienced responses lasting a median 17.5 months per independent review, while Rybrevantâ€™s median duration of response came in atÂ\\xa011.1 months in their separate trials. Exkivity helped patients lived a median 7.3 months without disease progression, versus 8.3 months for Rybrevant.\\nâ€œThis is pretty exceptional in this patient population because the background before targeted treatments like [Exkivity] youâ€™re looking at two to four months of progression-free survival,â€\\x9d Warren said.\\nThe two drugsâ€™ ability to extend life appears similar, as Exkivity patients lived a median 24 months, compared with 22.8 months for Rybrevant.\\nOn the downside, Exkivity is linked to a higher rate of serious side effects. One common side effect was diarrhea, which appeared in over 20% patients. For the phase 1/2 trial that earned Exkivity its FDA go-ahead, Takeda just added two more cohorts in May with extra antidiarrhea prophylaxis measures.\\nTakeda amended its protocol so that it can â€œensure that there are adequate protocols for diarrhea management and prevention â€¦ so the patient can get the maximum benefit out of the medicine while managing the adverse event,â€\\x9d Farajallah said. \\nExkivityâ€™s safety profile is â€œvery consistentâ€\\x9d with other oral EGFR inhibitors, so physicians are already accustomed to managing these side effects within the drug class, Warren added.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0The curious case of Eohilia: Takeda drug hit with mysterious FDA delay as company leans on launches for growth\\nIn the meantime, both Takeda and J&J are pursuing approvals inÂ\\xa0newly diagnosed NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 alterations. The phase 3 EXCLAIM-2 trial is pitting Exkivity against chemo in the front-line setting, and the trial could read out first data in 2022. \\nJ&J is taking a different path for Rybrevantâ€™s phase 3 study. In the phase 3 PAPILLON trial, its Janssen unit is pitting the combination of Rybrevant and chemo against chemo alone for exon 20 patients. Separately, the MARIPOSA trial combines Rybrevant with Yuhan-partnered small-molecule EGFR inhibitor lazertinibâ€”which in January won approval in South Korea as Leclazaâ€”against Tagrisso in the broader exon 19 and exon 21 mutation group.\\nExkivity is part of Takedaâ€™s Wave 1 pipeline, which includes about a dozen products the company hopes canÂ\\xa0bring in about $10 billion in aggregate peak sales. But the group of meds has suffered setbacks lately. A concentrated immunoglobulin drug Takeda developed with CSL Behring failed to move the needle in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Just a few days ago, pevondedistat flunked in a phase 3 blood cancer trial.\\nIn addition, Eohilia has its FDA decision for eosinophilic esophagitis mysteriously delayed with no known action date. And European authorities recently converted an application for dengue vaccine TAK-003 from a fast track to regular review.\\n\"},\n",

People who identified as lesbian, transgender and nonbinary were even more likely to feel ignored, according to the research.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nâ€œWhat that data tells me is that thereâ€™s a huge market thatâ€™s not being tapped into,â€\\x9d said Craig Beyerle, supervisor of paid social for CMI.Â\\xa0\\nThe survey found less than a quarter (21%) of cisgender gay and bisexual men strongly or somewhat agreed that â€œpharmaceutical companies adequately outreach to and understand my identity as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary and/or queer individual.â€\\x9dÂ\\xa0\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Â\\xa0GSK Consumer partners with Gay Times for LGBTQ+ inclusive ad campaigns\\nMeanwhile, only 8% of transgender and nonbinary participants and just 6% of cisgender lesbian and bisexual women agreed; 39% of all respondents were neutral.\\nThose who disagreed gave various reasonsÂ\\xa0such as seeing only heterosexual couples in pharmaÂ\\xa0ads or feeling that their unique healthcare needs arenâ€™t recognized. Others cited the high cost of medications like hormone treatments or HIV drugs.\\nBeyerleÂ\\xa0attributes the higher positive response among gay men to recent education and awareness campaigns around PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) treatments to prevent HIV. The federal government now requiresÂ\\xa0most health insurers to cover HIV prevention pillsÂ\\xa0such as Gileadâ€™s Truvada and DescovyÂ\\xa0with no cost-sharing.\\nâ€œI think itâ€™s great that we can get that PrEP coverage, but thereâ€™s more to us than that,â€\\x9d said Beyerle, who is gay. â€œA lot of us within this community also have high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and various different disease states that require just as much attention.â€\\x9d\\nRespondents also expressed some of the same negative perceptions that continue to dog pharma among the general population, such as the belief that companies put profits ahead of patients.\\nâ€œAs long as pharmaceutical companies are primarily driven by profit, they have no capacity to understand or care about me or other people in my community,â€\\x9d a Latina lesbian from Nevada commented.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Gilead lets local HIV community groups take the lead with $3M grant\\nSo how can pharma companies build trust in the LGBTQ community?

Both drugs have accelerated approvals to treat NTRK solid tumors regardless of their location in the body.\\nRather than a head-to-head clinical trial, the conclusion came from a so-called matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). An MAIC analysis improves upon regular cross-trial comparisonsâ€”for example, comparing Vitrakviâ€™s trial data to Rozlytrekâ€™sâ€”by matching trial patientsâ€™ data based on baseline characteristics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the current study, researchers pooled data from three Vitrakvi trialsâ€”LOXO-TRK-14001, SCOUT and NAVIGATEâ€”using a cutoff date in July 2020, and compared them with published aggregate data for three Rozlytrek trialsâ€”ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2â€”with an October 2018 cutoff date.\\nThe researchers considered myriad factors when matching patients, including gender, age, race, tumor types, NTRK gene subtypes, ECOG body function performance score, number of prior lines of therapy, metastasis status and brain metastases. Altogether, 117 Vitrakvi patients and 74 Rozlytrek takers were included for efficacy analysis.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Bayer's struggle to find Vitrakvi patients highlights broader diagnostics hurdles in pharma, likely exacerbated by COVID-19\\nVitrakvi reduced the risk of death by 57% versus Rozlytrek, the study found. Patients on Rozlytrek lived a median 23.9 months after a median 14.2 months of follow-up, while Vitrakvi still hasnâ€™t reached the survival midpoint after 16.9 months of median follow-up. Vitrakvi also showed improvement on cancer progression, though the number wasnâ€™t statistically significant.\\nBoth drugs showed similar ability to shrink tumors, as Vitrakvi spurred a response in 67.3% of patients, compared with 53.6% for Rozlytrek. But significantly more patients experienced no sign of cancer while on the Bayer drug; complete response rate for Vitrakvi was 20.3%, versus 6.8% for Vitrakvi. At 32.5 months, Vitrakviâ€™s response also lasted longer than Rozlytrekâ€™s 12.9 months.\\nFor safety outcomes, which included different patients, the researchers said they were â€œcomparable and lowâ€\\x9d for both drugs.\\nIn a statement to Fierce Pharma, Rocheâ€™s Genentech pointed out the Bayer studyÂ\\xa0is a retrospective analysis based on a small sample of patients. â€œThere are currently no head-to-head, prospective studies of Rozlytrek and Vitrakvi, which is the gold-standard for comparing two therapies, given the significant limitations to cross-trial comparisons,â€\\x9dÂ\\xa0Genentech said.Â\\xa0\\nThe Roche subsidiary also highlighted Rozlytrekâ€™sÂ\\xa0responses in tumors that have spread to the brain; industry watchers have argued that Rozlytrek is a better option than Vitrakvi in patients with brain metastases given the Roche drugâ€™s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Ready to rumble: Roche scores Rozlytrek OK to challenge Bayerâ€”and undercuts it on price\\nDrugmakers seldom turn to head-to-head trials for meds in the same drug class, especially when itâ€™s not required to win a regulatory go-ahead. These studies are costly and can be risky for showing a statistically significant advantage. In Vitrakvi and Rozlytrekâ€™s case, Bayer argues that a head-to-head randomized control trial isnâ€™t possible given TRK fusion cancer is rare.\\nBayer sure is motivated to show Vitrakvi is a better drug than Rozlytrek. When Rozlytrek gained its FDA green light in August 2019, about a year after Vitrakvi, Roche priced it at $17,050 per month, which marked a hefty discount from Bayerâ€™s list price of $32,800 per month, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat pointed out in a note at the time.\\n\\nWith an additional indication for ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer, Rozlytrek brought in sales of 22 million Swiss francs ($24 million) in the first half of 2021. In a note last week, Jefferies analyst Peter Welford projected peak Rozlytrek sales of $475 million.\\nBayer doesnâ€™t report Vitrakvi sales separately.

But shortly after the U.S. Treasury Department rolled out new rules in September 2014 to crack down on controversial so-called tax inversions, the company gave up on the merger.Â\\xa0\\nThat sequence of events led to some big losses at hedge funds, whichÂ\\xa0later sued AbbVie alleging fraud. In their lawsuits, the hedge funds said they bought Shire shares hoping the deal would closeÂ\\xa0but that they suffered losses when AbbVie walked away from the deal in October 2014. They said AbbVie\\'s public statements didn\\'t match with its private intentions for pursuing Shire.Â\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a decision Monday, Cook County Circuit JudgeÂ\\xa0Margaret A. Brennan ruled in AbbVie\\'s favor, granting summary judgement and tossing the hedge funds\\' claims.Â\\xa0The plaintiffs were \"kind of rolling the dice, hoping to make some money\" by buying Shire shares after the buyout announcement, the judge said.Â\\xa0They \"had to do their own analysis\" and \"had to be aware that there were possibilities that this may not come through,\" she added.\\nRepresenting AbbVie, Gabor Balassa of law firm Kirkland Ellis said the company\\'s statements about the merger talksâ€”both before and after the July 14, 2014, announcementâ€”contained cautionary language and opinions about the proposed deal,Â\\xa0not statements of fact.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Hedge fund sues AbbVie for scuttling $55B Shire buyout\\nThe hedge fundsÂ\\xa0saw things differently.

At the time, tax inversions were \"extremely controversial and nearly universally unpopular.\" In that environment, AbbVie developed a \"messaging strategy,\" he said, to talk up more favorableÂ\\xa0aspects ofÂ\\xa0the deal.Â\\xa0\\n\"AbbVie pursued this false messaging strategy to minimize government scrutiny of the deal, avoid long-term reputational harm as a tax avoider and to avoid losing essential Shire shareholder support for the deal,\"Â\\xa0Tannenbaum said.\\nSPECIAL REPORT:Â\\xa0Biopharma\\'s top broken, unfulfilled or abandoned promises | AbbVie, Rick Gonzalez\\nIn 2016, hedge fundÂ\\xa0Elliott Management sued AbbVie over the failed merger, and other funds followed with their own lawsuits over subsequent years.

The extended monopoly will cost American payers and taxpayers $14.4 billion over Humira's final four years of exclusivity, said I-MAK, which evaluates the effects of patenting strategies by biopharmaceutical companies.\\nAbbVie is following the same tacticÂ\\xa0with another of its blockbusters, Imbruvica.

              "  'D': 'While Congress and the U.S. government have sought to lower drug prices for years, the issue appears to be coming to a head once again in Washington, D.C. The proposals that officials are eyeing arenâ€™t new, but they could have outsized effects on some of the industry\\'s largest players.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalyzing the potential effects of drug pricing reform for European big pharma companies including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Sanofi, the team of analysts at ODDO BHF thinks Roche and Novo Nordisk stand to lose the most under the pricing proposals being discussed.\\nLast week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a plan aimed at tackling high drug prices in the U.S. by allowing Medicare price negotiations plus measures to improve competition and new public-private partnerships focused on research. U.S. drug prices are significantly higher than foreign prices, the agency notes, and allowing Medicare to negotiate is \"key to lowering out-of-pocket costs for consumers, governments and total drug spending,\" the plan (PDF) states.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong the large European drugmakers the ODDO team covers, Novo Nordisk and Roche get the biggest proportion of their sales from the U.S.\\' government insurance system.

As for cancer bigwig Roche, the analysts say that 12% of its sales come from Medicare Part B, which covers physician-administered drugs.\\nRELATED: HHS aims to use value-based care payment models to lower drug prices\\nThe latest round of pricing talks comes after years of discussion in D.C. Former President Donald Trump and his administration tried several strategies to lower prices during his term, but those efforts ran into various setbacks, and prices have continued rising along the way.\\nWhile there seems to be momentum on the issue now, it\\'s not certain pricing reform will happen, the ODDO BHF analysts point out. Medicare pricing negotiations are a \"flagship measure\" discussed during the recent presidential campaigns, but it\\'s \"one of the most debated and contested [proposals] by both Republicans and some Democrats.\" The analysts think there\\'s a \"very low\" chance the proposal will come to pass.\\nBut if Medicare pricing negotiations do become a reality, the analysts said there\\'s a risk it could spread to the commercial insurance system.\\nRELATED: With sweeping executive order, Biden puts drug pricing, anti-competitive strategies in the crosshairs\\nBefore last week\\'s HHS drug pricing plan, President Joe Biden in July issued an executive order calling on the agency to publish a plan to tackle drug prices, including by exploring Medicare price negotiations, importation and more. While that was the clearest drug-pricing signal from the White House at the time, Andrew Lacy, a partner in Goodwinâ€™s antitrust and competition practice, said via email that the \"wish list\" of policy goals may not become reality.\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': \"After the FDA last week slapped safety warnings and use restrictions on AbbVieâ€™s Rinvoq, Eli Lillyâ€™s Olumiant and Pfizerâ€™s Xeljanz, Wall Street has started rethinking itsÂ\\xa0calculations for the JAK inhibitor class. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on discussions with three industry experts, analysts with SVB Leerink believe the FDAâ€™s warning could have a range of effects on the medsâ€™ opportunities across inflammatory diseases.\\nJAKs could see big use reductions in rheumatoid arthritis in the near term, and theyâ€™re vulnerable to new competition in atopic dermatitis, the SVB Leerink analysts said in recent notes. On the other hand, inflammatory bowel disease still represents a big market for JAK inhibitors, while smaller indications such asÂ\\xa0psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis remain unchanged, according to the team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs one of the largest indications for JAKs, rheumatoid arthritis is already an approved use forÂ\\xa0Xeljanz, Olumiant and Rinvoq. But after Xeljanzâ€™s post-marketingÂ\\xa0study found heart-related side effects and cancer risks, a rheumatology industry leader SVB Leerink interviewed stopped starting new arthritis patients with the Pfizer drug, even though he had â€œconsiderable experienceâ€\\x9d with JAKs and liked their strong efficacy and oral dosing.\\nWhile the expert still prescribesÂ\\xa0Olumiant and Rinvoq to new patients, he expects to reduce up to one-third of his use of JAKs in rheumatoid arthritis in general. About 10% to 15% of his current rheumatoid arthritis patients are on JAKs now. As the final labels from the FDA kick in, JAKs will mostly be used after methotrexate and other small-molecule drugs, as well as TNFs and even other biologics such as Rocheâ€™s IL-6 inhibitor Actemra, the expert said.\\nNevertheless, the rheumatologist suggests JAKs may regain share three years from now as doctors get used to the labels and if no new safety signals appear. Among the three drugs, the expect prefers Rinvoq given available clinical data and marketing strategies. Rheumatoid arthritis makes up half of AbbVieâ€™s $8 billion estimate for Rinvoq sales in 2025.\\n\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0JAK inhibitors from Pfizer, AbbVie and Lilly hit with dreaded FDA heart safety, cancer warnings\\nAt $2 billion in potential 2025 sales, atopic dermatitis, or eczema, represents the second-largest indication AbbVie has planned for Rinvoq. That drug, plus Olumiant and Pfizerâ€™s investigational JAK inhibitor abrocitinib, all await FDA decisions on their eczema applications.\\nIn eczema, Sanofi and Regeneronâ€™s Dupixent has become the doctor'sÂ\\xa0go-to option, and analysts have always been expecting JAKsâ€™ use behind the IL-4/13 biologic. But now that the FDA has restricted JAKsâ€™ existing uses to patients whoâ€™ve tried but failed on at least one TNF inhibitor, a dermatologist that SVB Leerink has spoken with suggested novel pipeline drugs might jump ahead of JAKs in the treatment order.\\nThese possible new meds include IL-13 inhibitors such as Eli Lillyâ€™s lebrikizumab, anti-OX40 agents, and others, SVB Leerink proposed.\\nIn addition to newcomers, the FDAâ€™s cautious view on oral JAKsâ€™ safety profile threatens potential approvals for the meds at high doses for eczema, the dermatologist suggested. He argued the high doses are â€œcritical to the efficacy claimsâ€\\x9d of JAKs. Thatâ€™s because JAKs haveÂ\\xa0topped Dupixent on efficacy markers only at the higher strengths, the SVB Leerink analysts noted.\\nâ€œThe dermatologist notes that atopic dermatitis has variable disease symptoms, and without the flexibility to dose higher, patients may derive inadequate control of itch and other symptoms, thus limiting JAK usefulness,â€\\x9d the SVB Leerink team wrote in a note last week.\\nAmong the three JAK applications in eczema, the dermatology expert also favored Rinvoq because of its better efficacy-safety balance. \\nBeyond rheumatoid arthritis and eczema, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is another large potential marketÂ\\xa0for JAKs; AbbVieâ€™s 2025 IBD sales projection for Rinvoq is $1 billion. There, a gastroenterology specialist figured the FDAâ€™s changes to labeling donâ€™t affect JAK inhibitorsâ€™ advantage as oral agents, and their strong efficacy still far outweighs the potential risks.\\nWhatâ€™s more, the doctor pointed out the safety signals from Xeljanz were from rheumatoid arthritis, where patients are typically older with more cardiovascular risk factors.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0FDA's new JAK safety restrictions spell trouble for AbbVie's Rinvoq, but to what extent?\\nThe gastroenterologist, who works at â€œa large New York medical system,â€\\x9d said about 70% of ulcerative patients either donâ€™t respond to TNF inhibitors or canâ€™t remain in remission and therefore need further treatment. JAKs currently reach about 10% to 15% of IBD patients in the second-line settingÂ\\xa0and could expand to 25% to 35% in the next five years, the expert estimated.\\nThe IBD treatment paradigm is shifting toward oral drugs, the gastroenterologist predicted. To him, the trend favors JAK inhibitors, especially AbbVieâ€™s Rinvoq, which he suggested is â€œmodestly differentiatedâ€\\x9d from other in-class rivals. The SVB Leerink team, more bullish on JAKsâ€™ opportunity in IBD than AbbVie, pegged $3 billion IBD sales for Rinvoq in 2025.\\nAs for the smaller indications of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, the market opportunity for JAKs there has always beenÂ\\xa0limited, the SVB Leerink team noted in a Thursday note. In these two areas, TNFs and IL-17sâ€”mostly, Novartisâ€™ Cosentyx and Eli Lillyâ€™s Taltzâ€”have been â€œalmost universally successful,â€\\x9d and there was little need for JAKs, the rheumatologist that SVB Leerink interviewed observed. \\n\"},\n",

              "  'D': \"This year has already witnessed a handful of memorable FDA approvals. And if one thingâ€™s clear, the pandemic hasnâ€™t slowed biopharmaâ€™s ability to push prospects over the agencyâ€™s finish line.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThereâ€™s been Biogenâ€™s historic and controversial accelerated approval for Aduhelm in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Thatâ€™s not to mention Amgenâ€™s closely watched nod forÂ\\xa0Lumakras, the first lung cancer treatment to target what was once considered â€œundruggableâ€\\x9d KRAS mutations.\\nBut the race isnâ€™t over yet. Looking to close out 2021 with FDA approvals stand four potential blockbustersÂ\\xa0from the likes of Argenx, UCB, Pfizer and Roche,Â\\xa0according to Evaluate Pharma. Those meds combined are worth roughly $7.1 billion in sales cumulatively by 2026, according to Evaluateâ€™s estimates.Â\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother heavy-hitting hopeful in Evaluateâ€™s mid-year report, Ascendis Pharmaâ€™s long-acting growth hormone lonapegsomatropin-tcgd, nabbed its own go-ahead in late August. Now dubbed Skytrofa, that drug is expected to rake inÂ\\xa0$1.5 billion in sales by 2026.Â\\xa0\\n\\nScoring an FDA approval isn't a sure thing for the remaining contenders. For one, Pfizerâ€™s abrocitinib could face additional hurdles now that the agency has chalked up new safety warnings for a handful of JAK inhibitors following its investigation into Xeljanz. Other pipeline prospects, such as UCBâ€™s bimekizumab and Rocheâ€™s faricimab, will almost certainly face fierce rivals if they win theÂ\\xa0agencyâ€™s blessing.Â\\xa0\\nHereâ€™s a look at most valuable outstanding FDA decisions remaining in 2021, according to Evaluate:Â\\xa0\\nEfgartigimodÂ\\xa0\\nTaking the top spot for the most lucrative remaining FDA decision this year is Argenxâ€™s efgartigimod in myasthenia gravis (gMG), an autoimmune disorder that leads to loss of muscle function. The drug is up for a Dec. 17 decision date.Â\\xa0\\nIf approved, efgartigimod would become the first anti-neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) med to cross the agencyâ€™s finish line. Its prize? The first crack at a market that could be worth up to $25 billion in U.S. sales by 2030, according to SVB Leerinkâ€™s estimates.Â\\xa0\\nAs for Argenx, Evaluate sees efgartigimod bringing in $3 billion in sales by 2026. The Belgian company guesses it will have a three-year head start against some heavyweight FcRn competitors, such as Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s Momenta Pharmaceuticals, UCB and AstraZenecaâ€™s Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: Argenx's autoimmune phase 3 hits goals, teeing up FDA filing\\nEfgartigimod is designed to block FcRn, a protection receptor of immunoglobulin G (IgG). That method is thought to lower the pathogenic IgG antibodiesÂ\\xa0implicated in several autoimmune diseases.\\nIn MG, efgartigimod sits at the FDAâ€™s doorstepÂ\\xa0after posting promising late-stage trial data that showed it alleviated symptoms far better than placebo after 26 weeks, the first phase 3 win for an FcRn drug.Â\\xa0\\nAmong patients who took efgartigimod and tested positive for acetylcholine receptor antibodyâ€”an indicator of MGâ€”nearly 68% responded to the drug compared to just 29.7% of those on placebo, according to the company. Meanwhile, 56.8% of patients responded to efgartigimod for at least eight weeks, which dipped to 34.1% at 12 weeks.\\nArgenx is also trying to push efgartigimod through four other indications and is under review for gMG in Europe and Japan.Â\\xa0\\nBimekizumabÂ\\xa0\\nUCBâ€™s bimekizumab has tough competition ahead if the psoriasis monoclonal antibody scores an FDA nod come its Oct. 15 decision date.Â\\xa0\\nIf granted the agencyâ€™s go-ahead, the anti-IL-17A and IL-17F injection will enter the market with proof already in hand that it can top heavyweights from Johnson and Johnson and Novartis. It's expected toÂ\\xa0round upÂ\\xa0$2 billion in sales by 2026, Evaluate estimates.Â\\xa0\\nIn two separate, late-stage studies, UCBâ€™s bimekizumab managed to beat out J&Jâ€™s megablockbuster Stelara and Novartisâ€™ Cosentyx when it came to clearing moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patientsâ€™ skin.Â\\xa0\\nIn the trial against Stelara, bimekizumab helped 85% of patients achieve a 90% or greater reduction in the area and severity of psoriasis symptoms at 16 weeks, according to results published in The Lancet last year. Complete skin clearanceâ€”indicated by a score of PASI 100â€”occurred in 59% of patients.Â\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, Stelara helped just half of patients reach the 90% threshold and complete skin clearance. With those results in hand, analysts estimated that bimekizumabâ€™s prospects could grow if the drugÂ\\xa0managed to do the same against Cosentyx. And it did.Â\\xa0\\nIn results published in The New England Journal of Medicine in August, bimekizumab managed to completely clear about 62% of patients' skin after 16 weeks compared to Cosentyxâ€™s nearly 50% showing. However, bimekizumab was tied to higher rates of mild to moderate oral candidiasis cases, or a fungal infection in the mouth.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: Bristol Myers' deucravacitinib beats out exiled Otezla, plots 2022 launch\\nTo be sure, UCB may face other hurdles outside the clinic. Thereâ€™s some concern that the crowded psoriasis field, which also includes AbbVieâ€™s Skyrizi and Humira, Eli Lillyâ€™s Taltz and Amgenâ€™s Otezla, could outmaneuver bimekizumab with their massive marketing budgets. And even more rivals may be on the way from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer.Â\\xa0\\nFaricimabÂ\\xa0\\nDuring the pandemic, Bayer and Regeneron weathered the storm with their blockbuster eye drug Eylea and even managed to growÂ\\xa0their med'sÂ\\xa0market share along the way.\\nNow, Roche is hoping to tip the scale back in its direction with its up-and-comer faricimab as the FDA weighs decisions in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME), expected by yearâ€™s end.Â\\xa0\\nThe Swiss pharma has proven that faricimab can at least match the worldâ€™s sixth best-selling drug last year in the clinic. Roche found in four phase 3 trials that the bispecific antibody, which targets VEGF and Ang2, didnâ€™t do worse than Eylea despite the majority of patients taking it during longer dosing intervals.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: Roche, Novartis are revving up next-generation eye drugs, but are they true contenders?\\nAcross the trials, about half of patients were able to last four months on faricimab compared with two months on Eylea. That could give Roche a much-needed leg up given that the drugs are injected through a patientâ€™s eye.Â\\xa0\\nButÂ\\xa0it may not be a big enough boost to catch up with Regeneronâ€™s sizable lead. Evaluate pegs faricimabâ€™s 2026 sales at $1.1 billion, far less than what Eylea is currently generating.\\nAbrocitinibÂ\\xa0\\nNow that federal regulators have finally concluded their months-long safety investigation into Pfizerâ€™s Xeljanz, a wave of JAK decisions loom on the agencyâ€™s horizon. That includes one for the Big Pharmaâ€™s other atopic dermatitis drug, abrocitinib.Â\\xa0\\nBut how well abrocitinib fares is now up in the air given that inquiry turned up unfavorable results that have already reverberated throughout the JAK class, analysts wager. The FDA recently pegged new heart safety and cancer warnings for Xeljanz, AbbVieâ€™s Rinvoq and Lillyâ€™s Olumiant, and some analysts expect a similar warning could be coming for abrocitinib, too.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: JAK inhibitors from Pfizer, AbbVie and Lilly hit with dreaded FDA heart safety, cancer warnings\\nFor its part, Evaluate has estimated abrocitinib could reach blockbuster status with $1 billion in sales by 2026. Thatâ€™s just a third of Pfizerâ€™s own expectationsÂ\\xa0for potential peak revenues.Â\\xa0\\nRegulators have shot down other JAK inhibitors in the past over safety concerns, notably for Gilead's filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Pfizer nor the FDA have given any indication on whether the investigation could hinder abrocitinibâ€™s ability to cross the finish line.Â\\xa0\\nNonetheless, abrocitinib has turned up some wins on its way to the agencyâ€™s decision desk. In late August, Pfizer said its oral med bested Sanofi and Regeneronâ€™s Dupixent when clearing patientsâ€™ itch and eczema symptoms at weeks 2 and 4, although key details surrounding its safety remain unknown.Â\\xa0\\n\"},\n",

In a more important win, Pfizer said a few days ago that the phase 3 JADE DARE trial found 200mg Cibinqo, a once-daily oral tablet, beat Sanofi and Regeneronâ€™s blockbuster injection drug Dupixent in reducing itch and helping patients achieve near complete skin clearance.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Pfizer's abrocitinib beats blockbuster Dupixent in phase 3 eczema trial, but key questions remain\\nPfizer has pegged Cibinqoâ€™s peak sales potential at $3 billion, arguing that a large number of atopic dermatitis patients arenâ€™t getting a systemic agent. During a conference call with investors last October, Hwang said that gaining even only an 8% share of the systemic atopic dermatitis market would mean $3 billion in revenues for Cibinqo at peak.\\nBut that rosy outlookÂ\\xa0looks shaky after the FDA last week slapped new safety warnings and use restrictions on Xeljanz as well as AbbVieâ€™s Rinvoq and Eli Lillyâ€™s Olumiant. The FDA is updatingÂ\\xa0boxed warnings forÂ\\xa0the drugs to include language about the risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots and death. In a more damning move, the FDA is limiting approved use of the drugs to patients who have tried but failed on at least one TNF blocker.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0FDA's new JAK safety restrictions spell trouble for AbbVie's Rinvoq, but to what extent?\\nThe restrictions spell trouble for Cibinqo, because the FDA is viewing the safety signals as a class-wide problem, even though the drugs target different members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of enzymes. While Xeljanz seems to target JAK3, with weaker actions on JAK1 and JAK2, Cibinqo is designed as a specific JAK1 inhibitorÂ\\xa0and so is Rinvoq. In a note last Wednesday following the FDAâ€™s announcement, SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said he expects Cibinqo will get the same restrictions and labeling language. \\nAfter one FDAÂ\\xa0postponement in April, the agency againÂ\\xa0pushed backÂ\\xa0the med's atopic dermatitis application in July. The drug doesn't have a new known PDUFA data.\\n\"},\n",

In a prespecified analysis of the combined trials, pegcetacoplan was more effective in patients with extrafoveal lesions at the start of the trials, decreasing GA lesion growth in that group by as much as 26% in the monthly arm and 23% in the every-other-month group.\\nGA patients typically present first with extrafoveal lesions, which then progress toward the fovea where central vision is impacted, Apellis says.Â\\xa0Thatâ€™s important because the disease is like a forest fire in the retina, continuously destroying photoreceptor cells until someoneâ€™s blind with no way to turn it around, Francois said.Â\\xa0\\nThere are roughly 1 million Americans living with the condition and 5 million people globally.

That has teed-up a showdown between Apellisâ€™ C3 inhibitor and Alexion's heavyweight C5 inhibitors Soliris and its follow-up Ultomiris, which target a different enzyme.Â\\xa0\\nâ€œIf this drug gets approved, it will be the first time that complements control would get approved in a large speciality, rather than in a rare disease like PNH,â€\\x9d Francois said. â€œI think it opens up a new era for what a complement can do in many of these conditions across multiple therapeutic areas.â€\\x9dÂ\\xa0\\n\"},\n",

The company had previously posted a negative annual growth rate since 2015, up until its $750 million buyout of Ranir in 2019, according to the note.\\nâ€œThat said, overall we are positive on the HRA transaction, and it could well prove to be a prudent short-term deployment of capital,â€\\x9d Jefferies said.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Perrigo's generics split is back on the docket, thanks to $1.55B Altaris offer\\nPerrigo has faced a bumpy road on its journey to focus on consumer self-care products. In late 2019, the company was forced to postpone the planned sell off of its lagging prescription generics business before finally landing a suitor in Altaris Capital Partners for $1.55 billion.Â\\xa0\\nWith that deal, Altaris picked up Perrigoâ€™s â€œextended topicalâ€\\x9d medications, like creams, foams, mousses, gels, liquids and inhalable productsâ€”including a copycat of Tevaâ€™s ProAir HFA inhaler.Â\\xa0\\nNow, with Perrigoâ€™s HRA deal, it will stash its over-the-counter portfolio with Compeed, used to treat blisters, bunions, calluses, corns, cracked heels and cold sores. Perrigo will also pick up ellaOne, an emergency contraception pill, and Mederma, which is used to treat scars, stretch marks and cold sores.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Perrigo, Catalent get generic of Teva inhaler approved on 4th go-round\\nAbout 15% of HRAâ€™s sales are also derived from its prescribed rare disease drugs, Metopirone, Ketoconazole HRA and Lysodren.Â\\xa0\\nWhatâ€™s appealing to Perrigo, however, has been HRAâ€™s ability to switch its products from prescription to over-the-counter, executives said. Case in point: HRAâ€™s recent U.K. nod for Hana as a once-daily OTC oral contraceptive, the first approval of its kind, Perrigo said.Â\\xa0\\nâ€œIt's literally a one-of-a-kind opportunity to simultaneously enhance our financial profile, while driving even greater value for consumers, shareholders and the communities in which we work and live,â€\\x9d Kessler said.Â\\xa0\\n\"},\n",

But after talking with the FDA, the company and partner PharmaMar see a new path forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn previously treated SCLC, the combination of Zepzelca and doxorubicin failed to extend patientsâ€™ lives overÂ\\xa0physicianâ€™s choice of doxorubicin-based chemo or Hycamtin, according to data presented at the 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer virtual meeting.\\nJazz and PharmaMar first unveiled the phase 3 ATLANTIS failure in December. Now we know patients who mostly got the Zepzelca regimen as their second-line treatment lived a median 8.6 months, versus 7.6 months in the control arm. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf successful, the trial could have served as the confirmatory trial to convert Zepzelcaâ€™s accelerated approval earned last June into a full one. In a previous single-arm study, Zepzelca monotherapy shrunk tumors in 35% of relapsed SCLC patients as measured by investigator assessment. The response lasted a median 5.3 months.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Jazz preps first solid tumor launch with Zepzelca's small cell lung cancer nod\\nPascal Besman, chief operating officer at PharmaMar, noted that the ATLANTIS study used a 2-mg/m2 dose of Zepzelca, which is lower than the FDA-approved dose of 3.2-mg/m2. Although the Zepzelca-doxorubicin combo didnâ€™t improve survival, â€œthe overall results support the activity and tolerability of Zepzelca monotherapy in second-line therapy,â€\\x9d Besman said in an email interview.\\nAs ATLANTIS investigator Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., noted in a prepared presentation, the research team ran a so-called exposure-response analysis to gauge Zepzelcaâ€™s contribution on patient survival. The model predicted that single-agent Zepzelca, at the 3.2-mg/m2 dose, would have had a statistically significant advantage over the control arm at prolonging the lives of patients in the ATLANTIS study.\\nJazz stands â€œfirmly behind the favorable benefit/risk profile of monotherapy Zepzelcaâ€\\x9d in second-line SCLC as shown in its phase 2 trial, the companyâ€™s chief medical officer, Rob Iannone, M.D., said in a separate email interview.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Jazz recognizes less-common small cell lung cancer patients' needs with new online initiative\\nFor now, Zepzelca will remain on the market. Jazz and PharmaMar haveÂ\\xa0agreed â€œin principleâ€\\x9d with the FDA to run another phase 3 as the confirmatory trial, Besman said.\\nThe three-arm trial will test Zepzelca monotherapy at 3.2 mg/m2, and a second experimental arm will combine the drug at 2 mg/m2 with Pfizerâ€™s Camptosar (irinotecan).\\nSecond-line patients in the control arm will get physicianâ€™s choice or either Camptosar or Hycamtin. The trial, expected to launch this year, will also support a regulatory filing to the European Medicines Agency, Besman added.\\nIn addition, Jazz is collecting data from an observational phase 4 trial to understand Zepzelcaâ€™s real-world profile in second-line SCLC, Iannone noted.\\nMeanwhile, Jazz is also looking to move Zepzelca earlier in the treatment line. Through a partnership with Roche, aÂ\\xa0phase 3 trial dubbed ImForte will test Zepzelca with immunotherapy as a first-line maintenance therapy for patients with extensive-stage SCLC after induction chemotherapy. If successful, the new regimen could pressure AstraZeneca and its Imfinzi, which is currently dominating the front-line SCLC space.\\n\"},\n",

              "  'D': 'After two high-profile late-stage trial flops, AstraZeneca has finally scored a victory for Imfinzi and ill-fated tremelimumab in newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). But in a lucrative field where immuno-oncology rivals Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb have established a solid presence, a detailed look at the data reveals a win thatâ€™s perhaps too little, too late. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA cocktail of Imfinzi, investigational CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab and chemotherapy pared down the risk of death by 23% over chemo alone in previously untreated patients, AZ announced Thursday at the 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer virtual meeting.\\nThe phase 3 POSEIDON trial came after two prior phase 3 flops for Imfinzi in metastatic NSCLC and marked the first positive pivotal readout for treme after many more failures in multiple indications. But the data donâ€™t look favorable compared to Merckâ€™s Keytruda or Bristol Myersâ€™ Opdivo, and efficacy in some patient subgroups showed imbalances that could limit an eventual FDA approval if AZ gets one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst off, the combination of Imfinzi and chemo failed to significantly outdo chemo alone at extending patientsâ€™ lives. That pairing only reduced the risk of death by 14% over chemo alone. That already makes Imfinzi lookÂ\\xa0inferior to current standard-of-care Keytruda. \\nKeytrudaâ€™s combo with chemo is well known for its impressive 51% death risk reduction over chemo alone in front-line non-squamous NSCLC. Those were the resultsÂ\\xa0at an interim analysis in the phase 3 Keynote-189 trial, while the final analysis at 31 months of follow-up showed a 44% risk decrease. As for front-line squamous cell NSCLC, Keytruda and chemo reduced death riskÂ\\xa0by 36% at interim and 29% at final analysis in the KEYNOTE-407 trial.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0AstraZeneca\\'s lagging I-O drug tremelimumab finally pulls through with Imfinzi combo score in lung cancer\\nLuckily for AZ, treme finally pulled through to help Imfinzi. The CTLA-4 agent has a bad track record with Imfinzi and has been marred with failures in NSCLC as well as small cell lung, head and neck and bladder cancers. In front-line NSCLC alone, the dual immunotherapy combo of Imfinzi and treme flopped the phase 3 MYSTIC trial in a broad patient group and the NEPTUNE trial in patients with high tumor mutation burden. \\nNow that the Imfinzi-treme-chemo doesnâ€™t appear likely to shake up Keytrudaâ€™s dominance, what about less competitive Opdivo? Data donâ€™t look very promising for AZ.\\nFor one thing, while the chemo-free regimen of Imfinzi and treme failed, Opdivoâ€™s own CTLA-4 combo with Yervoy is approved for front-line NSCLC patients whose tumors express PD-L1. \\nFor a better apple-to-apple comparison, the Opdivo-Yervoy-chemo combo won an FDA nod last year for front-line NSCLC patients regardless of PD-L1 status. In the CheckMate 9LA trial, Opdivo, Yervoy and chemo were able to show a survival benefit early, having cut patientsâ€™ risk of death by 31% over chemo after a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months. After a longer follow-up of at leastÂ\\xa024.4 months, the rate stood at 28%, as patients on the Opdivo-Yervoy-chemo regimen lived a median 15.8 months versus 11 months for the solo chemo group.\\nImfinzi-treme-chemoâ€™s 23% death reduction looks slightly weaker than Opdivo-Yervoy-chemoâ€™s 28%, but cross-trial comparisons have their problems. In POSEIDON, patients on the AZ therapy lived a median 14 months, versus 11.7 months for those who took chemo alone.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Bristol Myers Squibb\\'s Opdivo, Yervoy score another lung cancer OK, this time alongside chemo\\nTo further complicate the front-line NSCLC landscape, Rocheâ€™s PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq is allowed as a monotherapy for PD-L1-high patients thanks to data from the IMpower110 trial.Â\\xa0And its combo with Avastin and chemo has an approval for non-squamous disease after showing it reduced the risk of death by 22% over Avastin and chemo.\\nSanofi and Regeneronâ€™s Libtayo also bears a monotherapy nod in front-line PD-L1-high NSCLC. The companies recently found that adding Libtayo on top of chemo could further prolong the lives of first-line patients in the phase 3 EMPOWER-lung 3 trial. \\nEli Lilly and Innovent Biologics have a front-line non-squamous NSCLC filing for their China-approved PD-1 inhibitor Tyvyt under review at the FDA. The application includes data from a China trial that showed a combination of Tyvyt, Lillyâ€™s Alimta and platinum chemo could stave off tumor progression or death over chemotherapy alone.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Sanofi, Regeneron stop Libtayo-chemo lung cancer trial early on strong survival data\\nFor AZ, non-squamous NSCLC might be just what it could eventually reach for with the Imfinzi-treme-chemo pairing.\\n\\nImfinzi, treme and chemo showed limited survival benefits\\nin squamous patients. (Melissa Johnson/WCLC 2021)\\n\\nAs POSEIDON lead investigator Melissa Johnson, M.D., noted during a prepared presentation Thursday, among patients with the squamous histology, progression-free survival (PFS) \"and overall survival were poor across all treatment arms, with little separation of the curves for PFS or overall survival.â€\\x9d\\n\\nIn the squamous subgroup, Imfinzi, treme and chemo only managed to reduce the risk of death by 12% over chemo.\\nWhatâ€™s more, the AZ therapy also showed some worrisome signs in other patient subgroups. Notably, women and Asian patients didnâ€™t seem to experience any additional survival benefits from Imfinzi and treme. \\nThe one upside? The efficacy of Imfinzi, treme and chemo didnâ€™t seem to be bound by a patientâ€™s PD-L1 expression level.\\nStill, with the mixed bag of data and a poor track record, AZ could face a limited FDA label and a hard time winning over market share in front-line NSCLC. Imfinzi is currently approved to treat stage 3 NSCLC and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. In the first half of 2022, AZ plans to read out data from PEARL, an IMpower110 counterpart trial that evaluates Imfinzi monotherapy against chemo as front-line treatment for PD-L1-high patients.\\n'},\n",

Looking to gain an early leg up, pharma companies have tried to pin their antibodies against up-and-coming migraine meds in an effort to woo over patients and doctors.Â\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcept aÂ\\xa0new analysisÂ\\xa0from Teva pitting its long-acting injectable Ajovy against oral foes from Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and AbbVie doesnâ€™t appear to separate the drug from the pack as much as the companyÂ\\xa0likely hoped.Â\\xa0\\nIn the new data released on Wednesday, Teva looked to see how well Ajovy, Biohavenâ€™s Nurtec ODT and AbbVieâ€™s atogepant reduced migraines, as measured in days per month, when compared with placebo. The analysis is being presented during the International Headache Society and European Headache Federation Joint Congress.Â\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeva conducted a meta analysis, or a review of Nurtec's, atogepant's and Ajovy's separate clinical trials that compared those meds to a placebo. When pitted against trial data of every-other-day dosing for Nurtec ODT, Tevaâ€™s analysis found that the monthly 225 milligram and quarterly 675 milligram Ajovy injections reduced migraine daysÂ\\xa0by 1.3 and 1.02 days more, respectively.Â\\xa0\\nFurther, whileÂ\\xa0Ajovy outperformed atogepant slightly across all paired dosing strategies, it didnâ€™t reduce migraine days by more than a day on average.Â\\xa0\\nOverall for the analysis, no statistical significance could be determined, Teva's release said.\\nStill, Ajovy showed statistically significant benefits in several drug and dosing matchups, lead authors Michael Seminerio and Steve Silberstein said in an emailed statement. Seminerio serves as Teva's U.S. medical lead for migraine and headache, while Silberstein is a professor of neurology and the director of the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University.\\nThe authors countered that fremanezumab was either numerically different in favor of Ajovy or statistically significantly better than atogepant when comparing change from baseline in MMD.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Biohaven's Nurtec ODT outmuscles AbbVie's Ubrelvy in gaining new migraine patients following key FDA nod\\nWhile itâ€™s unclear whether the analysis will help boost prescriptions, the genericÂ\\xa0giant believes the comparisons â€œprovide clinicians with new insights into the impact of choosing a treatment option for each individual patient,â€\\x9d Tevaâ€™s Matthias Mueller, MD, VP of global medical affairs, said in a release.Â\\xa0\\nTeva's med has lagged rivals from Eli Lilly and Amgen since launching in 2018, but its sales have gained steam lately. Ajovy brought in $70 million in second quarter global revenues, compared with Emgalityâ€™s $156 million and Aimovigâ€™s $82 million.Â\\xa0\\nThe new analysis comes months after Biohaven's Nurtec ODT scored a potentially market-shifting FDA nod in May to prevent episodic migraines, or fewer than 15 days of headaches per month. Itâ€™s now the first and only oral anti-CGRP drug approved as a dual therapy for both acute and preventive use. Hot on its tail, however, is AbbVieâ€™s oral atogepant. That drug is currently awaiting an FDA nod to prevent migraines.Â\\xa0\\nAnalystsÂ\\xa0seeÂ\\xa0Nurtec ODT shaping up to become a â€œmajor migraine player.â€\\x9d Biohaven reported in early July that Nurtec ODT, also known as rimegepant, raked in $93 million in sales during the second quarter, a whopping 112% increase compared with the previous quarter.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Eli Lilly pins injectable migraine med Emgality against Biohaven's oral rival Nurtec ODT in head-to-head study\\nTeva isnâ€™t the only company trying to tamp downÂ\\xa0Nurtecâ€™s advances.

Based on that finding, Welford figured Polivy can generate $1.2 billion in peak sales in front-line DLBCL from the U.S. alone.\\n\\nThanks to a 2019 FDA approval, Polivy is currently approved to treat relapsed or refractory DLBCL after at least two prior therapies. The drug currently gets someÂ\\xa0off-label use in the second-line setting.\\nAmong patients who arenâ€™t eligible to undergo stem cell transplant, Polivy is currently used in about 37% of second-line DLBCL patients, Jefferiesâ€™ survey suggests. ItsÂ\\xa0use in third and later lines represents about 29% of the market, according to the analysts.\\nFive years from now, Polivyâ€™s second- and third-line use could decrease to 20% and 17%, respectively.

Given mosunetuzumabâ€™s better safety profile, Welford argued Roche may target the community setting with the drug and leave the more aggressive glofitamab to specialist hospitals. \\nOverall, Welford put down $2 billion in peak sales for each of the two bispecifics with a 60% chance of success.\\n\"},\n",

Teva thinks the work done to develop the long-acting mechanism and to create a subcutaneous formulation puts it in a position to compete on benefits, not price, with branded competitors.Â\\xa0\\nRELATED: Teva's long-acting schizophrenia drug hits goal in phase 3\\nTalking to investors in July, CEO KÃ¥re Schultz said Teva plans to launch the risperidone formulation at a price that is comparable to branded, patent-protected long-acting injectables. Schultz is aiming to take 10% of the market. Given J&J makes billions of dollars a year from its schizophrenia franchise, Teva will generate significant sales if it captures 10% of the market without undercutting on price.Â\\xa0\\nâ€œI think it's quite a big opportunity, because the pricing on LAIs is quite stable and good in the marketplace. And the pricing of LAI has really not gone generic for the new and better products, so that means that we will be launching probably with a price that's the average price of branded patent-protected LAIs,â€\\x9d Schultz said.\\n\"},\n",

Fosun Kite Biotechnology, a joint venture between Fosun Pharma and Gilead Sciencesâ€™ Kite Pharma, claimed the first-to-market title in June with their approval for Yescarta in the same disease setting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust like the relationship between Kiteâ€™s two CD19 CAR-T products, Yescarta and Tecartus, relma-cel expresses the same CD19-targeting CAR construct as Breyanzi. The difference is that relma-cel uses a manufacturing process developed in China that doesnâ€™t require separate CD4 and CD8 T-cell production trains, JW says.Â\\xa0\\n\\nIn a single-arm, pivotal trial dubbed Reliance, relma-cel triggered a response in 75.9% of 58 evaluable patients at any time point during the study. Further,Â\\xa0investigators saw no signs of cancer in 51.7% of patients throughout the study as of an analysis last June.\\nAmong all 59 treated patients, only 5.1% and 3.4% experienced cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity, respectively, at grade 3 or above. The two side effects are commonly linked to CAR-T treatments. In a Friday statement, JW said relma-celâ€™s high response rates and low rates of CAR-T-related side effects â€œmay provide a best-in-class CAR-T therapy profile.â€\\x9d\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0JW Therapeutics rakes in $300M Hong Kong IPO to bring CAR-Ts to China\\nTo prepare for the launch, JW has established a 10,000-square-meter manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China. The plant has the capacity to support the production of autologous CAR-T treatment of up to 2,500 patients per year, according to the companyâ€™s half-year report released last week. \\nAn in-house commercial team of 90 people is ready to roll, and JW has tapped Shanghai Pharma as its national distributor to take care of the logistics. \\nBut the more important question is perhaps pricing. Neither Fosun Kite nor JW has disclosed prices forÂ\\xa0their CAR-T drugs. Given how much CAR-T drugs cost in the Western world, the fear is that they will be too pricey for Chinese patients. \\nIn its half-year 2021 report, JW said itâ€™s â€œtargeting to establish a multi-layer insurance system by cooperating with different partnersâ€\\x9d to improve the affordability of relma-cel.\\nYescarta has an upper hand, though; its June approval allows it to be included for pricing and coverage negotiation in the upcoming National Reimbursement Drug List revision.\\nRELATED:Â\\xa0Bristol Myers' cell therapy Breyanzi, fresh off an FDA nod, eyes earlier lymphoma use with first-in-class win\\nBesides third-line LBCL, JW is also testing relma-cel in follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and second-line LBCL. The company is also developing a BCMA-targeted CAR-T that uses the same CAR construct as Bristol Myersâ€™ now discontinued orva-cel.\\nThe rivalry between Fosun Kite and JW is merely a tip of the iceberg of Chinaâ€™s increasingly crowded cell therapy landscape.\\nLegend Biotech, through a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, is close to the U.S. market for BCMA hopeful cilta-cel after scoring an FDA priority review in multiple myeloma. Allogene Therapeutics recently formed a joint venture with Chinaâ€™s Overland Pharmaceuticals to develop the U.S. biotechâ€™s allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, CAR-T therapies for the Chinese market. \\nAs of June 30, 2020, China has recorded 357 clinical trials for CAR-T therapies, including 175 trials for CD19-directed products, according to a recent article published in Cellular & Molecular Immunology.

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ Anticipating future approvals for neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in early-stage lung cancer, a team of Spanish investigators has identified a promising biomarker signature based on genomic analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which outperformed existing predictors like tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD-L1.\\nThe group published their findings in Clinical Cancer Research last month and are now hoping to validate them in a larger patient cohort with longer follow-up and survival data, which could support clinical translation.\\nUsing T cell receptor sequencing on samples from 40 non-small cell lung cancer patients in the phase II NADIM trial, the team identified two biomarker signatures â€” a domination of the TCR repertoire by the top 1 percent of clones, and overall TCR \\'evenness\\' â€” that predicted which patients would be free of disease when they received surgery.\\n\"To identify these CPR patients is key, since achieving CPR is associated with improved survival,\" Alberto Cruz-Bermudez, a researcher at Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda University Hospital in Madrid and co-first author on the study, said in an email.\\nAccording to Bermudez, the success of immunotherapy in later-stage lung cancer has raised hopes that the same drugs can also impact patient outcomes when the disease is identified early. Positive data has been building for regimens, which combine platinum-based chemotherapy with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. In the Spanish team\\'s case, this was nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s Opdivo). \\nMore recently, investigators were able to back this up in a phase III study, Checkmate 816, reporting at this year\\'s annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that they saw an added value of chemoimmunotherapy over chemo alone in terms of complete pathological response.\\nWhen survival outcomes from that trial are released in coming months they could support the first regulatory approvals for this strategy, said Bermudez.\\nHowever, oncologists have cautioned that predictive biomarkers â€” to identify responsive patients and save unresponsive individuals from unnecessary therapy â€” will be crucial in this space. A commentary by a team from Australia published in the Journal of Immunotherapy of Cancer this June, for example, highlighted the importance of precision strategies, \"choosing the right drugs, for the right patient, at the right time,\" in this emerging neoadjuvant context.\\n\"Despite the efficacy of immunotherapy, not all patients respond favorably to it. Knowing a priori whether the patient will benefit or not â€¦ can advance the application of precision medicine. In this case, the patient is given the treatment that is likely to give the best result, avoiding unnecessary toxicities, improving the prognosis of patients, and allowing the search for other therapeutic alternatives,\" Bermudez said.\\nIn their study, he and colleagues hoped to build on prior research into the connection between T cell receptors and immunotherapy response.\\n\"PD-L1 levels and TMB are the main biomarkers investigated in the neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials scenario,\" Bermudez said. But because the TCR repertoire offers a more direct view of the mechanisms whereby the adaptive immune system responds to immunotherapy and recognizes tumor antigens, investigators have hypothesized that it could provide a route to more precise predictive biomarkers. \\nUsing Thermo Fisher Scientific\\'s Oncomine TCR-B sequencing technology, the group analyzed TCR clonality in peripheral blood and tissue samples from 40 NSCLC patients, taken both before and after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in the NADIM clinical trial. \\nWhen they compared TCR profiles from patients who achieved pathologic complete response to those who didn\\'t, there was a clear definition between the two groups in terms of the \\'evenness\\' or balance of the TCR between different clones.\\nThe researchers thought that this relative uneven TCR status in better-responding patients might be because of a small number of clones dominating the total repertoire, and indeed, when they looked at the most frequency ranked clones, the top 1 percent occupied higher clonal space in complete responders than non-complete responders. \\nBoth biomarkers â€” TCR evenness and top 1 percent clonal dominance â€” were better response predictors in the cohort than PD-L1 and TMB.\\nBermudez reiterated that the team does not believe their data so far are enough to support development of a companion diagnostic strategy. But the group is working to build the type of replication study that could cement a TCR-based strategy in the clinic.\\nWith an established response biomarker, patients could be identified up front who might be better served by chemotherapy and close monitoring, avoiding the side effects and toxicity of immunotherapy to which they are unlikely to respond.\\nAnd in the future, Bermudez said, the field could begin to study whether individuals predicted to have complete responses would need surgery at all. \\n\"Surgery is currently considered key to cure these patients [but] the possibility of identifying these patients a priori with good sensitivity and specificity through TCR analysis opens the possibility of trials to test the usefulness of surgery in these patients,\" he said.\\nHe added that TCR analysis is relatively technically robust and doesn\\'t face significant roadblocks in terms of affordability or turnaround time. He noted, however, that considering the challenges faced by other predictors that deal with continuous variables, like TMB and PD-L1, it will be necessary to define precise thresholds for prediction and proactively seek standardization across sequencing platforms and technologies.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ A team based in Poland, the US, Bolivia, and Germany has turned to ancient DNA to untangle the population dynamics at a Central Andes site that became a prominent urban settlement in the time before Europeans arrived in South America, detecting relatively diverse ancestry that stretched from present-day Peru and northern Bolivia to the Amazon.\\nAs they reported in Science Advances on Friday, the researchers focused on the ancient civilization near Lake Titicaca that was known as Tiwanaku, which arose alongside new cultural and archeological markers, including a large monument platform called Akapana that was used for ritual human offerings.\\n\"For almost a millennium (500 to 1000 CE), Tiwanaku was one of the most influential centers in the southern Andes,\" first author Danijela Popovic, a researcher with the University of Warsaw\\'s Center of New Technologies, and her colleagues explained. \"More than 100 years of archaeological research has revealed how cultural and demographic changes in the Lake Titicaca basin preceded Tiwanaku\\'s emergence as the primary ritual center around 500 CE.\"\\nAfter screening samples from more than 90 ancient individuals from pre-Columbian burial sites, the team successfully sequenced DNA from 13 ancient Tiwanaku individuals â€” along with four individuals from distinct Wari and Inca populations found over time in southern Peru â€” with 0.15-fold to nearly 2.6-fold average coverage. The set included individuals who appeared to have been the subject of sacrificial offerings linked to the Tiwanaku culture.\\nBy combining archeological, paleogenomic, and present-day population genetic clues, the authors of the new analyses explained, they were able to get a look at the populations that resided or moved through Tiwanaku and their ties to broader ancient and modern-day populations.\\nAlthough local ancestry in the region appeared to be quite homogeneous over time, the authors reported, they saw subtle genetic differences that coincided with geography. Based on insights at almost 199,200 informative SNPs in ancient and available modern-day genomes, for example, the team saw genetic links between ancient residents of the Lake Titicaca basin and individuals living in Bolivia today. \\nAncient individuals in northern Peru tended to cluster separately from populations in the Titicaca area or in southern Peru. The Tiwanaku representatives, on the other hand, encompassed individuals with ancestry resembling that in ancient Peru or admixed individuals with ancestry from more far-flung sites such as the Amazon. That was particularly true when it came to remains found at the sacrificial Akapana site.\\n\"The new genomic and radiocarbon data reported here demonstrate that, in the mostly static genetic landscape of the Central Andes, in which each region seems to have maintained an inner homogeneity with little exchange with outside populations, people from both neighboring valleys and places much further afield â€” even outside the direct influence of the polity â€” found their way to the Tiwanaku site,\" the authors reported. \"Although we may never know the reason why certain individuals took or were taken for such a journey, our data suggest that they, and/or their descendants, left a trace at Tiwanaku.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€” A genomic analysis has found that the Etruscans who lived in central Italy during the Iron Age were closely related to neighboring populations, and their later genetic makeup was influenced by the reach of the Roman Empire.\\nThere had been debate over the origins of Etruscans, who spoke a non-Indo-European language and had striking metallurgic skills, stretching back to the ancient Greeks. The writers Herodotus and Hellanicus of Lesbos suggested that the Etruscans originated from Anatolia or the Aegean, while Dionysius of Halicarnassus postulated they arose from local Bronze Age Villanovan groups.\\nWith genomic data from 82 individuals that lived in Etruria and southern Italy over a span of nearly 2,000 years, an international team of researchers pieced together much of the population genetic history of the region. As they reported Friday in Science Advances, Etruscans had similar genetic profiles as those of their neighbors in Rome, despite their language differences, and had ancestry derived from steppe-related groups that arrived in the region during the Bronze Age. The genetic makeup of Etruscans then remained broadly stable but shifted with the establishment of the Roman Empire.\\n\"Our genomic analyses find an autochthonous origin of the Etruscans as supported also by archeological evidence,\" first author Cosimo Posth from the University of TÃ¼bingen wrote in an email. \"I was however surprised to observe such â€¦ genetic homogeneity for 800 years from the Iron Age to the Roman Republic period.\"\\nTo establish this timeline, he and his colleagues genotyped 82 individuals who lived in Italy during three broad time periods: the Iron Age and Roman Republic, the Imperial period, and between 500 and 1,000 years ago.\\nMost of the individuals who lived in Etruria during the Iron Age and Roman Republic clustered together in a principal components analysis. This cluster harbored three genetic ancestries associated with Anatolian Neolithic farmers, European hunter-gatherers, and Bronze Age pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and overall could be modeled as a mix of other European populations, suggesting Etruscans originated in that region.\\nFurther, the genetic ancestry of the Etruscan population from this time period was similar to that of Iron Age and Roman Republic individuals from Tuscany and Lazio, including the ancient city of Rome, even though Etruscans spoke a non-Indo-European-language.\\nIndo-European-languages spread across Europe during the Bronze Age in tandem with individuals who had steppe pastoralist ancestry, Posth noted, adding that this steppe ancestry was widespread in Italy during the Iron Age, including among Etruscan individuals.\\n\"Therefore, we identified here a rare example of language continuity despite large-scale genetic replacement, and we suggest this might be due to a prolonged period of admixture between the incoming steppe ancestry and local populations, who largely maintained their cultural identity,\" he said.\\nThe genetic makeup of Etruria changed during the Imperial Period, with an influx of ancestry related to Near East groups. \"The Roman Empire had a transformative impact on the local gene pool,\" Posth said, adding that he and his colleagues suspect that the changes were due to the arrival of slaves, soldiers, and merchants from the Near East to Rome and outlying areas.\\nThe region again experienced an influx of genetic ancestry, this time associated with Germanic individuals, during the Middle Ages when the Western Roman Empire collapsed. But between the Early Medieval time and present day, there has been broad genetic continuity.\\nGoing forward, Posth said obtaining additional Bronze Age genetic data from central Italy could help analyze admixture patterns related to steppe ancestry and the spread of Indo-European languages, while gathering additional ancient genomes from the Roman Imperial period could help to examine whether the genetic replacement observed in central Italy during that time occurred across the Italian peninsula.\\n\\n'},\n",

NPR reports that a CDC panel voted unanimously to allow older individuals and residents of long-term care facilities to receive a third shot as well as to allow younger individuals with underlying medical conditions to be able to receive another dose. \\nNPR notes, though, that the most contentious deliberations centered on whether people under 65 with jobs that placed them at increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 should also be eligible for the booster. There, it voted against allowing a third dose, it adds. This, CNN notes, breaks with the FDA emergency use authorization, reporting that the \"broad nature of the EUA did not sit well with several members.\"\\nHowever, the Times reports that even though the CDC usually follows the recommendations of the panel, Walensky instead aligned with the FDA authorization and determined that people at high risk of developing COVID-19 due to exposure at their jobs, like healthcare workers, are also eligible.

In the first piece, Genentech\\'s Jennifer Rood and Aviv Regev discuss the legacy of the Human Genome Project, how it has shaped scientific and clinical research and questions that it has left unanswered. Next, a team from the University of Maryland Carey School of Law describe a recently passed law in Maryland that regulates the use of consumer genetic data by law enforcement and how it may provide a roadmap for similar legislation in other states. Lastly, researchers in the US and abroad present four reviews looking at genomics in human health and history. The first examines efforts to characterize the molecular and cellular effects of genetic variants; the second discusses how scientists are understanding the role of polygenicity in common disease; the third covers initiatives to map the genomic and epigenomic factors involved in cancer; and the last focuses on how sequencing of ancient DNA is changing views of humans\\' evolutionary past.\\nA technique for the high-throughput single-cell quantification of hundreds of proteins using standard flow cytometry instrumentation is reported in Science Advances. Developed by a team led by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center investigators, the method â€” called Infinity Flow â€” combines hundreds of overlapping flow cytometry panels with machine learning to enable the simultaneous analysis of the co-expression patterns of hundreds of surface-expressed proteins across millions of individual cells. \"Infinity Flow enables broad phenotypicÂ\\xa0characterization of many cell subsets at the level of a whole organ\" and represents \"a highly scalable, low-cost, and accessible solution to single-cell proteomics in complex tissues,\" they write.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€” Genetic counselors may be in a position to help address medical racism and race-based disparities in healthcare, according to a panel discussion at this year\\'s National Society of Genetic Counselors meeting.\\nMedical racism can have profound effects on people\\'s lives. Carla McGruder, a genetic counselor at Color Health, noted that it has been linked not only to high blood pressure and strained mental health but also lower life expectancy. Additionally, medical racism is not just a past but an ongoing harm that can take a number of forms, including in genetic counseling. \\nRace-based medicine, in which raceÂ\\xa0â€” a social construct that might not reflect a person\\'s genetics â€”Â\\xa0is used to guide clinical decisions, for instance, can affect prenatal carrier screening, cancer polygenic risk scores, and pharmacogenomic testing in a negative way by leading to different levels of care. But, as the panelists noted, there are also ways genetic counselors can address race-based disparities in healthcare.\\n\"Genetic counselors play key roles across genomic medicine from developing and ordering genetic tests, to variant curation and research, study involvement, to facilitating patient decision-making and educating other healthcare providers,\" Sally Rodriguez, a genetic counselor at Sequence46, said during a plenary session at the meeting, which was held virtually. \"This means that there are many opportunities for all of us to change the processes that are perpetuating racism and healthcare disparities.\"\\nMost genetic disease research and screening has been focused on white populations, which can lead to health disparities and care differences. This extends to carrier screening, such as for cystic fibrosis, Rodriguez said. \"[Cystic fibrosis] has had a lot of dedicated research due to its incidence, particularly in white populations, its severity, and its limited treatment options,\" she said, noting that in recent years there have been additional treatment options.\\nThe initial screening recommendations for cystic fibrosis from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics came in the early 2000s, but there was an emphasis on screening white populations, and screening was based on a limited mutation panel. Later recommendations from those and other groups have shifted to recommend screening for all populations, and a recent ACMG statement stated that race and ethnicity should not be factors in determining screening, calling it a scientifically flawed approach. As Rodriguez noted, self-reported race or ethnicity is not always a reliable indicator of genetic ancestry.\\nShe added, however, that a 2019 ACOG committee said that ethnic-specific, pan-ethnic, and expanded carrier screening are all acceptable screening options.\\nFor cystic fibrosis, she noted, nonwhite infants are more likely to carry mutations that aren\\'t included on panels, to be older at diagnosis, and to have significant health issues, and that Black and Hispanic individuals have a twofold higher risk of dying from cystic fibrosis before the age of 18.\\n\"When we spend less resources on certain genetic diseases or certain populations, there\\'s a downstream effect, and health disparities will inevitably arise in the carrier screening space,\" Rodriguez said. \"Those results and things like unknown carrier frequencies and uncertain detection rates in understudied populations miss carrier status or carrier couples, and thus [represent] missed opportunities for preconception or prenatal decision-making.\"\\nSimilarly, a lack of representation in research will have follow-on effects in other areas of clinical genetic testing and genomic medicine. \\nMcGruder said that polygenic risk scores for breast cancer are increasingly being used to model risk, but that these scores â€” which are currently mainly supposed to be for research â€” are, again, based mostly on data from individuals of European ancestry. \"And certainly, when it comes to PRS, we screamed and we ranted, and we continue to do so, because it leads to more inequality in breast cancer care,\" she said. Such inequality already exists, she noted: For example, even though Black women have a lower incidence of breast cancer than white women, they are 42 percent more likely to die from it.\\nPharmacogenomic testing and the interpretation of those results are also sometimes viewed through the lens of patients\\' race, ethnicity, or ancestry. But that does not necessarily lead to improved healthcare for all.\\nFor example, the presence of a certain SNP in the CYP2C cluster may mean something different for warfarin dosing if the person tested is African American versus from another background. The SNP is also found in other populations but has not been linked to warfarin metabolism in these, Elizabeth Fieg, a genetic counselor at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, noted.\\nBut there is no guideline for how to treat admixed populations, she added, noting that multiracial people are an increasing portion of the US population.\\n\"The reasoning behind race-based pharmacogenomics testing approaches is that testing high-risk groups is a more cost-effective strategy,\" Fieg said. \"But people can\\'t be easily sorted into cleanly defined [race, ethnicity, or ancestry] categories.\"\\nThe panelists said genetic counselors were positioned to push for changes in all these areas. Rodriguez said they could start by offering the same carrier or pharmacogenomic screening to all patients, no matter their race or ethnicity, while calling for guideline changes and pushing for increased representation of different populations in genomic databases and research studies. In turn, she said, this will increase patient access to treatments.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'C': '<p><span><span><span>Oncologists argued for and against comprehensive NGS at the point of diagnosis but agreed on the need to address quality and cost barriers first.</span></span></span></p>',\n",
              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ In an interactive session during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress on Tuesday, oncologists debated whether performing comprehensive molecular profiling on a patient\\'s cancer as early as possible following diagnosis is always the best choice. \\nAlthough the two presenters â€” Benedikt Westphalen, head of the molecular diagnostics and therapy program at the University of Munich Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Felipe Roitberg, a clinical oncologist at the Hospital Sirio Libanes in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil â€” were assigned to debate the supporting and opposing positions, respectively, both discussed some of the most pressing challenges facing doctors and patients when it comes to precision oncology, including molecular profiling access, cost, interpretability, and the evidence supporting the value of molecularly matched cancer treatment. \\nBoth Westphalen and Roitberg acknowledged that access to comprehensive, multigene tumor profiling varies drastically depending on the country and treatment setting and that not all clinicians are adequately prepared to make therapeutic decisions based on comprehensive molecular profiling results. Before they could debate the best time to implement such testing for patients, the presenters acknowledged that they must first address whether patients even have access to testing and if results are interpretable. \\nWhere do other oncologists stand?\\nThe structure of the ESMO session was such that audience members were initially surveyed on their position on three key questions. The audience then listened to both Westphalen and Roitberg\\'s presentations and voted again on the same three questions to determine whether the talks had swayed their sentiments. \\nThe first question asked participants to select the most important limitation affecting the clinical application of tumor molecular profiling. At the onset, 16 percent of audience members flagged the most important limitation as the limited efficacy of these tests, and the rest were evenly split, with 42 percent citing access barriers and 42 percent voting for interpretation difficulties. Following Westphalen and Roitberg\\'s presentations, responses to this first question remained more or less unchanged. \\nThe presenters\\' debate did shift opinions a bit on the second question, however, which asked oncologists to consider if they would recommend molecular profiling early on to guide therapeutic decisions if there were theoretically no constraints or barriers to test access. At the start, the vast majority of respondents â€” 96 percent â€” said, \"yes,\" they would offer patients early molecular profiling. After the presentations, however, the audience was a bit more divided, with 76 percent voting \"yes,\" 19 percent voting \"no,\" and five percent voting that they were unsure. \\nFinally, the third question asked the audience whether early molecular tumor profiling should be limited to clinical trials, whereas customized panels should be used in clinical practice. At the start, 37 percent agreed, 50 percent disagreed, and 13 percent were unsure. After the talks, the audience was almost evenly split, with 47 percent agreeing that early tumor profiling should be limited to getting patients on clinical trials and 53 percent disagreeing,\\nDrawbacks of early profiling\\nNotably, most of Roitberg\\'s arguments opposing molecular profiling at the earliest possible time point were related to access barriers. For patients diagnosed at cancer centers that don\\'t have their own in-house next-generation sequencing technology, which is more often the case, patients\\' samples must be sent out to commercial labs for profiling. This is not a major hassle when the commercial labs are nearby, but it can take a detrimentally long time when the sample must be sent to a lab abroad. \\n\"Do you have NGS panel [technology] in your institution, or only PCR or Sanger?\" he asked hypothetically. \"This is important, because if you want to send the sample abroad, you spend time waiting for the [results] from a panel that is perhaps done in another country in another setting, so it takes time.\" The lag time could hold up patients\\' ability to get on first-line therapy, and depending on the patient\\'s type and stage of cancer, this could negatively affect their survival outcomes. \\nEven at centers with in-house test access, Roitberg said that trying to rush comprehensive molecular profiling for urgent cases, where patients must begin treatment as soon as possible, can compromise biopsy and test quality and increase the risk of false positives or negatives.\\n\"If we aim to run, we must make sure we go fast but safe,\" he said. \"What I mean here is quality.\"\\nRoitberg also spoke to education and interpretation limits. Before deciding to send a newly diagnosed patient\\'s sample out for molecular profiling, he said, an oncologist needs to already have a good understanding of the range of molecular alterations that testing might uncover, the likelihood of specific, therapeutically actionable alterations showing up in different cancer types, and the benefits and risks of prescribing biomarker-guided treatments for patients. \\n\"Clinical benefit to patients involves understanding that the diagnosis that you\\'re expecting to obtain is clearly related to a treatment that you\\'re able to offer and that [there is] value,\" he said. \"Because if there is no meaningful benefit, what is the point of putting the patient in a rush and also exposing them to financial and psychological considerations and drawbacks related to this?\" \\nNecessity for early molecular profiling \\nWestphalen, speaking in favor of early molecular profiling, focused less on the logistics and quality concerns and more on the future direction of the field of oncology. By 2024, he estimated, there will be more than a dozen new molecularly targeted drugs, many of which will have tumor-agnostic implications. \"It won\\'t be enough to test single genes in single patients,\" Westphalen said. \"We need to cover all of our bases.\" \\nThis type of broad profiling is also necessary for driving innovation, he added, because the success of clinical trials evaluating these targeted drugs depends on biomarker tests identifying eligible patients. Westphalen cited data from Memorial Sloan Kettering\\'s IMPACT study showing that by comprehensively profiling 10,000 patients for molecular biomarkers, they were able to enroll 11 percent of those patients onto clinical trials, including patients with ultra-rare alterations that likely would not have been identified with single-gene tests or limited panels. \\nA chief component of Westphalen\\'s argument for earliest-possible molecular profiling was also the fact that by assessing all relevant biomarkers in a single test there is no need to do sequential, multiple single-gene tests. \\n\"This can save time because you cover all biomarkers at once; resources, because it\\'s cheaper to test all these biomarkers in one shot; and tissue because you don\\'t have to go back and test again and again,\" he said, adding that patients tend to derive the most benefit with targeted treatment when it\\'s incorporated into the first- or second-line setting. \\nFinancial constraints\\nWhile the two oncologists presented the advantages and drawbacks of early molecular profiling, during a post-debate discussion, they were of the same mind when it came to the matter of financial toxicity associated with these tests, the cost constraints of precision medicine as a whole, and the risks of using cost-effectiveness as a measure of value. \\nIn many health systems, presenting clear evidence of precision oncology\\'s cost-effectiveness is the key to improving access. Payors â€” governments or private and commercial insurers alike â€” want proof that an NGS test with a high price tag in the short term will match a patient to the right treatment, which theoretically could lower future costs if it meant that the patient would stop progressing and wouldn\\'t need further tests, procedures, and additional lines of treatment.\\nBut parameters for proving this are challenging and vary tremendously by location and healthcare systems. \\nRoitberg characterized cost-effectiveness analysis as \"tricky\" due to this variation. At its core, cost-benefit analysis is an assessment of the benefit of healthcare interventions within the constraints of a budget, he explained. \"But for some countries like my country, Brazil, where the inequality is so large â€¦ where you have a few people with lots of money and a large number of people with [very little], this equation does not fit a threshold in terms of understanding the overall ability to pay. â€¦ So, the reimbursement model matters.\"\\nImportantly, Roitberg underscored the need to have cost-related discussions not only about the price of the comprehensive NGS test itself but also of the targeted drugs that come next and the additional care that could be needed if the patient progresses on that drug. \\nThese discussions need to take place not only among payors and health systems at large, Roitberg said in his presentation, but also between oncologists and patients directly. He cited survey data showing that nearly a quarter of oncologists who discussed genomic or genetic testing with their patients reported never or rarely discussing their associated costs. \\nWestphalen echoed Roitberg\\'s points on the importance of discussing cost openly and transparently. \\n\"All patients should have the ability to undergo comprehensive genomic profiling,\" he said. \"And only if we have this in our back pocket and talk about this openly and clearly will we ever get to a point where it\\'s not about financial toxicity, but a given that we profile.\" \\n\"What is going to happen in the next five years,\" he predicted, is that \"we arenâ€™t [going to be] arguing, \\'Is it too early or too late?\\' but \\'Has it been done?\\'\"\\n\\n'},\n",

These cells are morphologically and functionally distinct but arise from common lineages within the medial ganglionic eminence. To better understand the origin of these cells, researchers from New York University compared the RNA expression and chromatin accessibility in the precursors to these cells during embryogenesis.

The maintenance of their distinct fates is stabilized in mature cells through the crystallization of unique chromatin landscapes, the study\\'s authors write. \"Our analysis revealed that RNA expression gives an instantaneous measure of the developmental state of a cell, whereas chromatin provides both a history of the developmental progression of a cell and a predictor of its future identity.\"\\nCombining genomic data and computational analyses, a team led by researchers from Mexico\\'s Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute have reconstructed the migration history of Polynesia, a series of islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean.

              "  'D': '\\n\\nST. PAUL, MINNESOTA â€“ Researchers from the University of Minnesota have developed a library preparation method for Pacific Bioscience\\'s Sequel platform that addresses the challenge of sequencing DNA molecules that are too long for short reads but not long enough to make long-read sequencing cost effective. \\nTheir solution: link up the sequences to get a molecule that can be analyzed using PacBio\\'s circular consensus sequencing protocol. \\nIn a paper published last week in Scientific Reports, the researchers, led by Nisha Kanwar and Burckhard Seelig of the University of Minnesota, described a version of concatenation sequencing that they developed for their work in protein engineering. \\nTheir approach uses Â\\xa0the Golden Gate assembly method of cloning to link DNA sequences about 800 bases long. \"This is the Death Valley. Illumina can\\'t do it anymore, but for PacBio, it\\'s wasting their power,\" Seelig said. \"Our method is not a new invention but significantly improves upon the previously published [methods].\" Each original sequence gets linked to four others, creating a molecule about 5 kb long. \\n\"This paper shows that you can improve accuracy while not sacrificing length of read,\" Tim Whitehead, a protein engineer at the University of Colorado who was not involved with the study, said in an email. \"It is a really elegant demonstration of how library preparation can be used with existing commercial sequencers to improve error rates. This is an incredibly important problem for these sorts of directed evolution campaigns where you are sequencing variants with very high pairwise identity, so [low] error rates are crucial.\"Â\\xa0\\nSeelig\\'s lab focuses on trying to find new, more efficient enzymes by starting with huge libraries of trillions of DNA molecules and winnowing those down. \\n\"When we make a library, we have no way to even analyze that library,\" he said. In vitro selection helps find winners, but each round takes time and money. \"Ideally, you do fewer cycles and use deep sequencing at an early stage to see what you\\'ve got. It allows us to see things that are not the winners, but runners-up that for some other reason might be even more interesting.\" \\nTo add to the technical challenges, Seelig is also constrained by funding. \"We\\'re an academic lab, we can afford $1,000 here and there, but not much above $15,000,\" he said. \\nThese were the constraints that led Seelig and Kanwar, then a postdoc in the lab, to come up with their PacBio-based concatenation sequencing protocol. They declined to say what kind of enzyme they were working on, citing a pending publication. \\nBut they had pools of sequences they wanted to learn about and needed a method that would let them see single-base differences, which could be important for protein function. \\n\"This was a means to an end,\" Kanwar said. \"We were more interested in data than building a technology at the time.\" Some other sequencing methods, such as one using unique molecular identifiers with Illumina NGS, required more computing power or expertise than she had access to at the time. \"That\\'s why we ended up with this route of stitching the molecules together,\" she said. \\nThe method is an adaptation of concatenation sequencing, a method developed by Roche Sequencing Solutions and published in 2017, that solves some issues. Seelig said his team has not sought intellectual property based on their tweaks.\\nImprovements included linking the fragments using overhangs so that the concatenation is directional, making each construct a defined length, and using short connector sequences. \"You\\'re wasting sequencing ability if you have really long adapters,\" Seelig said. \\nThe results were good enough that the team wanted to make it available to other researchers. \"The resolution that we got from our different stages of the experiment is really high,\" Seelig said. \"We really could distinguish tiny differences between families and big differences between rounds of directed evolution.\" \\nFor this, they made an additional request of their bioinformatics collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles, Celia Blanco and Irene Chen. \"We could have said, \\'Just do it for us,\\'\" Seelig said. \"But we were more ambitious and asked, \\'Can you write this up and make it for dummies like me?\\'\" The result was DeCatCounter software, which is now available on GitHub. \"It\\'s user friendly for people who don\\'t have much bioinformatics experience at all. It should be able to easily adjust this to whatever your sequencing parameters are,\" Seelig said. \\nTotal costs included the Golden Gate assembly, library multiplexing, and PacBio sequencing on a single flowcell that had nine different barcoded DNA libraries on it, Seelig said. \\nHis hope is that both protein engineering and other researchers could find use for it. \"It\\'s for anything 400 bp and beyond that. Most proteins are around that intermediate length,\" he said. \"PacBio can sequence really long, but only a few proteins are really that long.\"\\nSeelig and Kanwar ultimately ran their experiment on the PacBio Sequel I, but they said it should work on the newer Sequel II, as well, which will only increase efficiency. \\nThe Sequel II, they said, enables accuracy of 99.9 percent on reads 10 kb to 15 kb. \"Using these hardware improvements in the case of ourâ€‰[approximately] â€‰870Â\\xa0bp libraries, we would concatenate ten instead of five genes per amplicon, leading to an additional twofold increase in throughput,\" the authors wrote. Overall, advancements could increase sequencing depth 16-fold and analyze protein libraries with longer DNA sequences. \\nWhitehead suggested that \"with some minor tweaks\" the method could be compatible with other sequencing platforms, such as those from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. \\n\"Researchers sequence a lot of short things because they know they can do it on Illumina,\" Kanwar said. \"Maybe they\\'re not looking at longer [reads] because of that factor. If that\\'s the case, this would be a nice method to help change that.\" \\n\\n'},\n",

While pottery artifacts linked to the Jomon period have been detected as far back as 16,500 years ago, for example, wet rice paddy-based agriculture has been traced back some 3,000 years to the start of the Yayoi period. On the other hand, the Kofun period has been linked to an imperial state, with additional technological advances and a central political system.\\n\"We now know that the ancestors derived from each of the foraging, agrarian, and state-formation phases made a significant contribution to the formation of Japanese populations today,\" co-senior author Shigeki Nakagome, a researcher at Trinity College Dublin, said in a statement. \"In short, we have an entirely new tripartite model of Japanese genomic origins â€” instead of the dual-ancestry model that has been held for a significant time.\"\\nThe investigators started by screening 14 ancient bone or tooth samples at six archeological sites in western and central regions of Japan, ultimately subjecting 12 samples to shotgun sequencing, including nine samples from the initial, early, middle, and late Jomon period and three Kofun period samples. The genomes were analyzed alongside published genomes for two Yayoi representatives dated at 2,000 years old and three individuals from late stages of the Jomon period.\\nThe team\\'s nuclear genome and mitochondrial haplogroup analyses highlighted the three ancestral groups contributing to the populations in Japan, while offering clues to the origins of groups migrating into the area. In particular, the Yayoi population that introduced wet rice agriculture showed genetic ties to Korea and other parts of northeast Asia, whereas the Kofun period was marked by new East Asian ancestry.\\nBased on admixture patterns, the authors found that agricultural populations in the Yayoi period carried both Jomon ancestry and ancestry from northeast Asia, whereas all three ancestry groups were represented in the genomes of the Kofun individuals and in today\\'s Japanese.\\n\"Our data provide evidence of a tri-ancestry structure for present-day Japanese populations, refining the established dual-structure model of admixed Jomon and Yayoi origins,\" the authors reported, adding that \"ancestors characterizing each of the Jomon, Yayoi, and Kofun cultures made a significant contribution to the formation of Japanese populations today.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

During tumorigenesis, tumors must evolve to evade the immune system and do so by disrupting the genes involved in antigen processing and presentation or by upregulating inhibitory immune checkpoint genes. To gain a better understanding of this process, a team led by investigators from Harvard Medical School performed in vivo CRISPR screens in syngeneic mouse tumor models, which allowed them to examine the requirements for tumorigenesis both with and without adaptive immune selective pressure. In each tumor type examined, they found a pronounced overlap between adaptive immune system-specific hits and the genes that are among the most frequently mutated in human tumors. \"Our results demonstrate that loss of a large number of TSGs can contribute to immune evasion, increasing our understanding of tumor biology,\" the study\\'s authors write. \"It will be important to determine whether mutation of these TSGs can serve as biomarkers for immune modulating therapies.\" Additionally, establishing isogenic lines with expression or knockout of immune system adaptation TSGs will allow the study of we can study how a particular TSG changes the tumor\\'s interaction with the immune system to evade it, which could lead to new therapies that restore immune recognition of cancer.\\nA previously uncharacterized driver of genomic instability and inflammation in cancer is reported in Science Advances this week. DNA alterations such as nucleotide changes and chromosomal rearrangements are a hallmark of most human cancers, often correlating with patient prognosis and therapy selection, but the underlying mechanisms of genomic instability in cancer is poorly understood. In the study, a group led by Case Western Reserve University researchers identify the cytoplasmic unconventional Myosin X (MYO10) as a regulator of genomic instability, showing that it is upregulated in both human and mouse tumors and that its expression level impacts tumor progression and response to immune therapy. The scientists also find that MYO10 and its overexpression creates an inflammatory tumor microenvironment that leads to T cell exhaustion, which promotes tumor growth. Meanwhile, inhibiting inflammation or disrupting MYO10 significantly suppressed tumor growth in mouse models of breast cancer.\\n\\n'},\n",

One recent analysis found that 67 percent of polygenic risk scores were developed using cohorts of only European ancestry, and other studies have revealed that polygenic risk scores are not always portable across ancestries, likely due to differences in causal variants, linkage disequilibrium, allele frequencies, and effect sizes. \\nBut in some cases, cancer polygenic risk scores developed in European ancestry populations may be able to be adapted to gauge risk in other populations, a new study appearing in PLOS GeneticsÂ\\xa0has found. \\nResearchers from the University of Michigan School of Public Health developed polygenic risk scores for breast and prostate cancer using data from a European ancestry cohort and applied the scores to African, East Asian, European, and South Asian ancestry groups. While the risk scores were not directly transferable, the researchers found that if they considered the top 10 percent of risk scores within each population group, they could identify individuals at increased disease risk, suggesting this approach could be used as a stopgap measure while more diverse GWAS are conducted.\\n\"Though there are many efforts underway to increase diversity in genetic studies, the prevailing lack of diversity will continue for the foreseeable future,\" first author Lars Fritsche, an associate research scientist at UMich, wrote in an email. \"But we need solutions that work with the data we have right now, even if they are not ideal.\"\\nHe and his colleagues generated polygenic risk scores for breast and prostate cancer using the European subset of the UK Biobank. They then applied the scores to the four main ancestry groups represented in the UKB: African, East Asian, European, and South Asian. Overall, breast cancer polygenic risk scores were higher on average among non-European populations, while prostate cancer polygenic risk scores were higher among AfricanÂ\\xa0but lower among East and South Asian populations. This indicates the scores cannot be directly transferred, the researchers noted, as a high risk score among Europeans for breast cancer, for instance, would then fall at the low end of the distribution for other populations.\\nBut the researchers noticed that if the scores were scaled within each ancestry group, they could identify people with higher risk of cancer. \\n\"We didn\\'t expect to see this relatively consistent enrichment of cases in the top tails of the risk scores across the analyzed ancestry groups,\" Fritsche said. \"On the contrary, we were originally interested in documenting the limited transferability of polygenic risk scores for cancers across ancestries,Â\\xa0but then spotted the obvious differences in the risk score distributions between cases and controls within each ancestry group.\"\\nWhile this scaling approach could be useful for stratifying disease risk, it might not be applicable to all cancer types or diseases and is only a temporary solution. According to Fritsche, the approach might be best suited for traits that are common across ancestry groups, for which common genetic variants can explain a large portion of heritability, and for which there is ample data to generate a polygenic risk score as well as case-control data from various ancestry groups to place those scores into context.\\nFritsche noted that for many complex common diseases, genetic factors influence risk alongside environmental and demographic factors, and that they need to be combined to predict disease outcomes. He and his colleagues are now using genetic biobanking efforts in combination with electronic health record, census, and other data to develop better prediction models and possibly uncover modifiableÂ\\xa0health disparities.\\n\\n'},\n",

The firm recently expanded a collaboration with Janssen Research & Development, in which the drugmaker is using ConcertAI\\'s real-world data and machine-learning algorithms to bring its drug trials to communities that traditionally find themselves underrepresented in clinical research. \\nThe collaboration with Janssen is one of several partnerships ConcertAI is engaged in aimed at improving accessibility and equity in clinical research through real-world data. \"This is an area of significant research emphasis and investment at ConcertAI,\" JeffÂ\\xa0Elton, the company\\'s CEO, said in a statement.\\nConcertAI collects a variety of real-world data â€”Â\\xa0including genomic and clinical â€”Â\\xa0from patients. The company\\'s clinical research clients use its Patient Care Monitor platform, for example, to gather deidentified patient-reported outcomes, which can be correlated with other clinical factors such as cancer stage at diagnosis, sociodemographic factors, and genetic test results to create a detailed picture of a patient\\'s experience. \\nThe company also draws on data within electronic medical records, the multiomic CancerLinQ database, and from multiple regional health systems and community providers. ConcertAI uses proprietary machine-learning algorithms to analyze and glean insights from this data, for example, which drugs work better or worse in molecularly defined patient groups, which patients are most likely to benefit from a clinical study, and which patients aren\\'t but should receive genomic testing and associated treatments. \\nReal-world data of this type can also be valuable to researchers searching for patients to participate in clinical studies, particularly if they are aiming to enroll a diverse cohort. \\nRelatively few cancer patients participate in clinical trials and those who do tend to be white and have the means to travel to research sites at academic facilities. And, according to one estimate, a quarter of cancer trials fail to enroll the required number of patients. \\nRecent analysis of real-world data has revealed access disparities in precision cancer care, which involves biomarker testing and access to investigational drugs based on the results. For example, there are now a handful of precision oncology drugs on the market for non-small cell lung cancer patients who harbor certain genomic tumor alterations. Even so, data presented at the recent America Society of Clinical Oncology meeting suggest that less than half of NSCLC patients are being tested for all guidelines-backed biomarkers for which there are approved drugs, and that Black patients have more limited access to biomarker testing and clinical trials compared to their white counterparts. \\nThese disparities have persisted for decades despite being well known, but ConcertAI and its collaborators believe that their real-world data-driven approach can help mitigate them.\\nLast year, Janssen began using ConcertAI\\'s Genome360 platform, which includes in-depth treatment profiles on patients, as well as information about the molecular features of their tumors based on next-generation sequencing. The drugmaker is applying this real-world data within several of its oncology therapy trials, although it did not specify exactly which ones.\\nNajat Khan, chief data science officer and global head of strategy and operations at Janssen R&D, is also optimistic that with the help of real-world data, Janssen can improve racial disparities in its drug studies. The drugmaker\\'s collaboration with ConcertAI is helping it decentralize studies, essentially bringing the trial to the patients, rather than requiring thatÂ\\xa0they travel to far-away study sites. \\n\"It\\'s important to start with the right type of data,\" Khan said, explaining that the drugmaker is particularly interested in real-world data that can help it select trial sites in locations that \"ensure[s] access for patients from underserved populations.\" Using real-world data, Janssen has homed in on locations where a clinical trial site would bolster minority enrollment, Khan noted. \\nBeyond Janssen, ConcertAI works with approximately 35 life sciences customers, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the Quality Cancer Care Alliance, and ASCO.\\nPast and ongoing real-world data projects include characterizing the differences in clinical symptoms between Black and white women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer prior to chemotherapy, developing COVID-19 resources for providers and researchers in the oncology field, and supporting more inclusive clinical trial designs through a series of grants under the company\\'s Engaging Research to Achieve Cancer Care Equality initiative.\\nConcertAI, however, is operating in a crowded field and competes with companies such as Syapse and Roche subsidiary Flatiron, which are also working with drugmakers, health systems, and regulatory bodies to identify missed opportunities in precision medicine and genomic testing. \\nSyapse, for example, worked with the Henry Ford Health System to identify breast cancer patients who had not received adequate genomic testing and understand why, so that information could be used to improve future patient care.\\nAgainst these and other competitors, ConcertAI said it aims to differentiate itself by delivering a more fully integrated end-to-end suite of services, from data acquisition through analysis. Elton is optimistic about ConcertAI\\'s position and trajectory.\\n\"The field remains very early, but very promising,\" he said, highlighting that in the future there will be \"enormous opportunities\" to use real-world data and AI solutions to improve understanding of the physiology and genetics underpinning treatment-associated adverse events and why patients don\\'t respond to certain drugs. \\n\\n'},\n",

The cells were treated with distinct EGFR-targeting therapies, including conventional kinase inhibitors that interfere with enzyme binding and more novel treatments that involve target protein degradation.\\nThe approach relies on a combination of diverse cellular barcoding and sequential single-cell sequencing, the team explained. While the barcoding step makes it possible to follow clonal fitness in expanded, untreated cell cultures and in subsets of this culture exposed to different drugs, the scRNA-seq profiles provide a peek at the expression changes behind these cell responses.\\n\"[W]e developed TraCe-seq to rapidly capture the origins and early adaptive processes underlying therapy response by simultaneously measuring clonal fitness and their transcriptional trajectories in a heterogeneous population subject to anti-cancer treatments,\" the authors explained, arguing that the approach \"enables direct and comprehensive comparisons of different therapeutic modalities at subpopulation and single-cell resolutions and provides insights into pre-existing transcriptional features that dictate drug response and subsequent resistance.\"\\nAfter assessing TraCe-seq in several cell types, the investigators applied the method to EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells treated for four days with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (Genentech\\'s Tarceva), an EGFR inhibitor/degrader compound called GNE-104, or a similar compound called GNE-069 that does not degrade the protein. \\nBased on barcode diversity patterns in pre- and post-treatment cells, along with 10x Genomics scRNA-seq profiles for thousands of untreated cells or cells exposed to each compound, they saw more pronounced post-treatment fitness in the lung cancer cells treated with the EGFR inhibitor/degrader GNE-104 compared with the cells treated with erlotinib or GNE-069, despite a dip in MAP kinase pathway activity in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells exposed to all three drugs. Their findings suggested that targeted EGFR degradation resulted in more modest anti-cancer growth effects than more conventional inhibitor compounds.\\n\"Our results suggest that targeted degradation is not always superior to enzymatic inhibition and establish TraCe-seq as an approach to study how pre-existing transcriptional programs affect treatment responses,\" the authors wrote.\\nThe team delved into treatment response differences â€” as well as the transcriptional features found in cells that were vulnerable to treatment and in treatment-resistant cells â€” with corresponding expression data from treated and untreated cells subjected to scRNA-seq. When it came to EGFR inhibitor response, for example, the results highlighted a role for endoplasmic reticulum stress, offering clues for developing future treatment approaches.\\nMoreover, the authors suggested that a similar strategy may be used to interrogate treatment responses in other cancer cell types and therapeutic settings.\\n\"We anticipate that the TraCe-seq approach will guide the development of future therapies by revealing unknown features that predict response and resistance to different molecular modalities or treatment combinations,\" the authors wrote, noting that \"the TraCe-seq barcoded population could be sampled at multiple time points to gather transcriptional information with clonal resolution over time, thus providing a generally applicable approach for studying the evolution of heterogeneous populations under a variety of contexts.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€” A recent Ebola outbreak in Guinea may have been due to the resurgence of a persistent or latent infection from a prior epidemic that ended in 2016, according to a new sequencing analysis. This unexpected re-emergence could have ramifications for both public health and outbreak survivors.\\nEarlier this year, Guinea experienced an Ebola virus disease outbreak near GouÃ©kÃ©, which was also the epicenter of a previous epidemic that affected not only Guinea but also Sierra Leone and Liberia between December 2013 and June 2016. The latest outbreak began in mid-February 2021 and lasted through mid-June.\\nBy sequencing samples collected from infected individuals during this latest Ebola outbreak, a team led by researchers in Guinea found that the new Zaire ebolavirus strains formed a phylogenetic cluster with samples from the 2013 to 2016 epidemic. As the recent viral lineage exhibited lower divergence from the previous epidemic than would be expected if the virus were circulating that whole time, the researchers concluded that the latest outbreak is likely due to a persistent infection with reduced replication or a period of latency, as they reported Wednesday in Nature. \\n\"Prior to February 2021, it was assumed that contact between humans and wildlife was necessary for the Ebola virus to spread to the human population,\" first author Alpha Kabinet Keita from the University of Conakry and the University of Montpellier wrote in an email. \"We learnt from the February 2021 Ebola outbreak that the virus could remain latent for a long time after infection in humans and reactivate itself to cause a relapse or a transmission that would lead to a new outbreak.\"\\nHe and his colleagues collected blood samples from 14 patients with confirmed Ebola Zaire from the new outbreak for sequencing. Three laboratories using different approaches sequenced each sample, and data from the three labs was pooled to construct 12 high-quality Ebola virus genomes that covered between 82.9 percent and 99.9 percent of the reference genome.\\nA maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction analysis placed the genomes from the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea as a single cluster within the Ebola viruses from the 2013 to 2016 epidemic. These newer genomes also shared 10 substitutions that arose during the previous epidemic, providing additional evidence that the two outbreaks are connected and that the new cases are not due to an animal spillover event.\\nHowever, there was a low number of other substitutions distinguishing the 2021 cluster branch from the earlier viruses. These 12 changes are fewer than what would be expected if the virus had undergone human-to-human transmission in the intervening years, the researchers noted. Instead, they suggested that the virus re-emerged following some form of latency or dormancy during persistent infection.\\nThis finding indicates that people could serve as reservoirs of the Ebola virus, Tulane University School of Medicine\\'s Robert Garry wrote in an accompanying commentary in Nature, adding that it is not surprising that the virus re-emerged in Guinea, which has a large number of Ebola survivors. He noted that viral persistence has been uncovered in some Ebola survivors but that it is unclear how the virus can be reactivated. \\nKeita and his colleagues wrote in their paper that their findings stress the importance of caring for and supporting Ebola survivors, though in a way that is not stigmatizing. \"In addition to consciousness-raising, a multidisciplinary protocol must be developed that integrates clinical, biological, and psycho-social monitoring, with a central place for anthropologists and effective involvement of the population in the monitoring process,\" Keita said.\\nHe added that his team is working on understanding the immunological determinants of viral reactivation.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ In an effort to help alleviate pandemic-related sample prep bottlenecks, researchers at the National Institutes of Health have developed a direct-from-sample testing protocol utilizing a common molecular lab reagent: Chelex 100. \\nInitially utilized to aid in DNA detection for early PCR-based forensic assays, the NIH team adapted Chelex for use with RNA. They found their method to yield equivalent results as standard extraction-based techniques for potentially aneighth of the cost, and it uses fewer plastic consumables.\\nAlthough Bio-Rad Laboratories has been marketing Chelex for decades, the firm has reported that sales of the reagent have increased significantly during the pandemic, as labs seek ways to keep COVID-19 testing running despite supply shortages.\\nChelex is an ion-exchange resin made of a styrene and divinylbenzene copolymer stuck to iminodiacetate ions. When mixed into a slurry with a sample, the resin sequesters ions like magnesium and calcium, as well as heavy metals. The insoluble resin particles can then be spun down and separated from the sample.\\nAlthough vendors had anticipated supply shortages would be short-lived, they persisted as the pandemic has waxed and waned.\\nAt the NIH\\'s National Eye Institute molecular diagnostics lab, Bin Guan, Robert Hufnagel, and colleagues set about to see if they could improve COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing. The lab typically does genetic testing for rare eye diseases, but lockdown in April of last year led them to brainstorm ways around the supply chain crimps that quickly began cropping up.\\n\"We were thinking, what if we could obviate one of the steps and find a way to skip the RNA extraction and do a direct detection,\" Hufnagel said in an interview. \"It would streamline the workflow, and you could still use the CDC probes and do RT-PCR,\" he said.\\nThe team drafted a proposal, then screened many direct detection-enabling molecules using inactivated virus to test out their ideas. \\nGuan had experience in the past teaching an undergraduate molecular biology lab and knew that Chelex 100 was a cheap and effective trick for students to prepare their own DNA from a saline mouth rinse.\\nChelex chelates the magnesium and calcium ions that DNAses need to function, and it is also hypothesized to absorb cell lysis products that may interfere with PCR, Guan said. \\nThe Chelex method was initially developed in the late 1980s. Researchers at Cetus Corporation â€” where PCR had been invented and patentedÂ\\xa0just a few years earlier â€” published in 1991 that it could be used to remove impurities and detect low concentrations of DNA in forensic samples. \\nSean Walsh, now a molecular diagnostics product developer at Veracyte, was part of that early study under the direction of Russ Higuchi, who is currently affiliated with Cepheid. In an email, Walsh said the team was developing what would become the first PCR-based forensic test and knew it would need to be very sensitive and also need to be used on small and challenging samples, like single hairs.\\nThe Cetus forensics team was very concerned about PCR contamination. \"We absolutely wanted our users to operate contamination free,\" Walsh said, adding that the Chelex method can be done in a single tube \"with few steps and no tube transfers.\" By minimizing the potential for contamination, the workflow was able to facilitate successful adoption of forensic PCR technology.\\nChelex for RNA-based MDx\\nAlthough the Chelex-based method has been known to work on DNA and was commercialized in the early 1990s, Guan said there had been few studies of the reagent on RNA. \\n\"RNAse also uses magnesium and calcium for optimum activity ... but the pH of Chelex suspended in water is 10 to 11,\" Guan said, adding that such alkaline conditions could degrade RNA, including the RNA-based genome of SARS-CoV-2.\\nThe team adjusted the pH of the Chelex solution closer to neutral. \"From there, it turns out to be great, and it preserves the RNA,\" Guan said. \\nUsing digital droplet PCR and synthetic samples, the NEI team found that they could detect as little as one genome copy of virus per microliter using their direct protocol.\\nBut as a rare disease molecular diagnostics lab, they needed collaborators in the clinic to handle infectious samples. Investigators at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research and the NIH\\'s Department of Laboratory Medicine joined in to perform testing on samples collected from local patients.\\nThe clinical results, published in iScience last month, showed the Chelex method has similar or better sensitivity compared to an RNA extraction method for both primary nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples.\\nMany other groups have published recipes for rapid and inexpensive direct detection of RNA during the pandemic. But Guan said the NEI method is unique in that it involves heat inactivation at 95 degrees for five minutes, which kills the virus and could be helpful to labs that aren\\'t authorized to handle live virusÂ\\xa0or in any future pandemics where a pathogen is not yet characterized. \\nSamples can also be collected into Chelex directly, so the prep steps would not require any pipetting, saving on time and pipette tips. \\nThe team also estimated that the cost of viral transport media, orÂ\\xa0VTM,Â\\xa0collection to be $1.70 per tube, and RNA extraction may cost around $6 per sample. They estimated the total cost of a non-VTM collection tube, the Chelex, and two other standard reagents for their method â€” low ethylenediaminetetraacetic acidÂ\\xa0tris buffer, also called low TE, and dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO â€” to be less than $1 per sample. \\n\"Thus, the Chelex method will save cost and reduce supply chain burden by eliminating the need for RNA extraction and VTM,\" the team wrote in iScience.\\nAlthough extraction produces pure, isolated RNA, NEI\\'s Hufnagel said that the team compared extraction-based methods to Chelex using simulated samples and many different buffer conditions, as well as head-to-head comparisons using clinical samples. Overall, the team showed that their direct detection method did not lead to decreases in sensitivity or specificity when the samples were subsequently analyzed using RT-PCR tests.\\nThe NIH is now pursuing licensing and co-development of the method. \\nHufnagel said the team also wants to enable other laboratories to use the method and noted that it makes primary samples shelf stable and suitable for mailing without concerns about RNA degradation. \"Outside of typical labs doing large-scale diagnostics for COVID, there may be others that have a need for remote collection and shipping where this could also be advantageous,\" he said. \\nThe NEI team had early discussions with Bio-Rad about the work, and Hufnagel said the discussions are ongoing. \\nBio-Rad Laboratories lists the NEI paper on its website, and Ertan Ozyamak, the firm\\'s global product manager for lab chromatography, also described the work in an article about Chelex earlier this year. \\nOzyamak said in an email that Bio-Rad offers different Chelex formulations for different applications. Its molecular biology grade Chelex resin is appropriate for nucleic acid extractions and allows the optimization of the Chelex suspension for a given application, but the firm also sells a specially formulated, ready-made 6 percent suspension of Chelex called Instagene Matrix.\\n\"During this pandemic, these products have become popular for viral RNA extraction globally,\" Ozyamak said, adding that sales of Chelex have also increased significantly.\\n\"We are projecting an almost doubling of sales numbers this year and interest is growing,\" he said, noting that Chelex-based extraction methods are appealing alternatives \"particularly because of the reduced sample prep time and the significantly reduced cost per sample in comparison to commercial extraction kits.\" \\nOzyamak said Bio-Rad has a continued interest in new approaches that customers may develop, but he also said the firm could not speak to future plans for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic use of Chelex at this time.\\n\\n'},\n",

De novo assembly of these reads can be resource-intensive, needing both time and computing memory.\\nResearchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Institut Pasteur have developed a new approach that uses minimizer-space de Bruijn graphs (mdBGs) to assemble long-read genomes. With this method, they put together a human genome in less than 10 minutes using eight cores and 10 gigabytes of random access memory, as they reported in Cell Systems on Tuesday. They similarly could quickly construct an index of a large collection of bacterial genomes that they then searched for signs of antimicrobial resistance genes, illustrating how being able to process sequencing data quickly could enable personalized medicine.\\n\"Until this work, a single human genome assembly took days and hundreds of gigabytes of memory, which is a significant obstacle towards personalized medicine,\" co-corresponding author Bonnie Berger from MIT said in an email. \"Our method mdBG reduces the computational resources to minutes on a personal computer â€” two orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.\"\\nMdBG relies on minimizers that represent short stretches of nucleotide sequences rather than single nucleotides. That way, mdBGs store a smaller portion of the total number of nucelotides, but without affecting the genome sequence. \\nThey applied their approach to assemble PacBio long reads from Drosophila and humans and compared the performance of mdBG to other assemblers like HiCanu, Hifiasm, and Peregrine.\\nFor Drosophila, rust-mdBG â€” the approach is written in the Rust language â€” assembled the genome in one minute and nine seconds and used 1.5 GB of memory. Peregrine, by contrast, took 40 minutes and 11 seconds and used 12 GB of memory. \\nMeanwhile, for a human assembly, rust-mdBG took 10 minutes and 23 seconds and needed 10 GB of memory, compared to 14 hours and eight minutes and 188 GB for Peregrine. \\n\"Beyond genome assembly, our mdBGs can also be used to search for antimicrobial resistance genes very efficiently across huge collections of bacterial genomes, which is key for personalized antibiotic therapy,\" Institut Pasteur\\'s Rayan Chikhi, the other corresponding author, added.\\nFor instance, the researchers applied mdBG to construct an index for a collection of 661,405 bacterial genomes, a process that took 3 hours and 50 minutes and needed 58 GB. They further queried the pangenome graph for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes, which took about 12 minutes, rather than seven hours with other approaches, and used less than 1 GB of memory.\\nCurrently, the approach works best using PacBio reads, the authors noted, as they have very low error rates, and they soon expect it to be able to handle Oxford Nanopore reads.\\nBerger and Chikhi added that they plan to further develop their approach, for example to resolve entire chromosomes without gaps. \"Thinking more broadly, we envision reaching out to field scientists and to help them develop fast genomic testing sites, going beyond PCR and marker arrays which might miss important differences between genomes,\" they said.\\n\\n'},\n",

Another significant challenge has been the small loading capacity of CE systems, which has limited the amount of sample researchers can separate and analyze using CE, which in turn limits the sensitivity of their mass spec analyses.\\nThese loading capacity limitations have been further exacerbated by the fact that in addition to the sample itself, a \"sheath liquid\" is in many setups required to establish the electrical connection used to separate the sample molecules. This sheath liquid further dilutes the sample, noted Kevin Jooss, a researcher at Northwestern University and one of the leaders of the CE initiative.\\nIn the past, Jooss said, these limitations meant researchers couldn\\'t with CE reach deep enough into samples to analyze the portions of the proteome that most interested them.\\n\"There were applications for CE-MS and proteins, but there were always sensitivity issues or complexity issues,\" he said. \\nNow, though, improvements in CE technology have enabled researchers to reach similar levels of sensitivity with CE as they could with nanoLC, Jooss said. \"We\\'re reaching now the stuff that people are really interested in, like the low-abundance proteoforms of cancer-related proteins, for example.\"\\nHe said that companies like Sciex and 908 Devices have improved the performance and ease of use of their CE technologies in response to demand from the biopharma industry.\\nAdvantages sustain interest\\nInterest in CE has endured despite the limitations of earlier iterations of the technology due to its several potential advantages, particularly for top-down and intact protein separations.\\nOne advantage is what Alexander Ivanov, associate professor of chemistry at Northeastern University and a leader of the initiative, described as CE\\'s \"open and tubular configuration,\" which allows it to separate proteins without denaturing them, making it a good fit for analysis of native proteins and protein complexes.\\nCE is also able to work with very small sample amount with little sample loss. Additionally, Jooss noted, CE systems are very flexible in that the capillaries can be coated with different compounds to optimize separations of different kinds of samples.\\n\"Usually you have your one LC column that has these properties, and if I want to analyze a different type of sample I need to switch to a different column,\" he said. \"With dynamic coating that is something you can avoid with CE because you can start with the same basic capillary and adapt it for your needs.\"\\nCE also provides sharper separation peaks than LC. Sun noted that it was particularly useful for separating larger molecules like proteins and protein complexes.\\n\"If the analyte diffuses more slowly, your separation efficiency will be higher,\" he said. \"So as we go from small molecules to peptides to proteins to protein complexes, we are getting bigger and bigger, and that means they diffuse slower, which means in theory we get better separation efficiency.\"\\nIn the case of LC, this slower diffusion leads to wider peaks and lower-quality data.\\nSun said that studies by his group and others have also demonstrated that CE offers significantly higher sensitivity than LC, noting that CE-MS can generate data comparable to that generated using LC-MS with tenfold to one hundredfold less sample.\\nHe cited as another potential advantage the relative ease of predicting the behavior of a protein in a CE device, which he said meant data on, for instance, a proteoform\\'s movement through a CE system could be used as additional information to confirm its identification.\\nThat said, \"there is still a long way to go to bring [the technology] to the next stage,\" Ivanov noted.\\nDevelopment of more stable and user-friendly interfaces between the CE and the mass spectrometer remain an area in need of improvement. Reproducibility of CE separations is also an issue as even small changes can alter results.\\n\"We are applying a high voltage to generate a current and move ions across the channel or capillary, and the composition [of the reagents used] changes,\" Ivanov said. \"If the run is too long, or if you use the same buffer for multiple rounds and multiple injections and we are depleting certain ions in the buffer, that can contribute to certain reproducibility issues.\"\\nJooss said that while CE has advanced to where it is possible to hit levels of reproducibility comparable to nanoLC, \"there are just more factors of variation [in CE]. For instance, if your background electrolyte pH is 4.0 or 4.1 can make a slight difference in your separation. So you have to be very rigid in how you prepare your samples.\"\\nThe consortium\\'s initiative aims to develop and promulgate standards and practices that will help researchers use CE most effectively. One question, for instance, is whether the inclusion of standards within CE runs can help with the reproducibility question by enabling researchers to normalize CE data across runs and labs.\\nThe participants also hope that raising the profile of CE will help drive uptake and technology development.\\n\"If someone was never taught CE properly or is even aware of its capabilities or existence, it\\'s unlikely they [will] decide on their own to venture into the field, which consequently has an influence on how it is perceived in industry and academia,\" Jooss said.\\nTo start the consortium has lined up 12 labs around the world that will analyze standardized protein mixtures using their in-house CE-MS setups to get a sense of what kind of data is generated using the various mixes of instrumentation and protocols in place.\\n\"We\\'re trying to demonstrate the CE-MS techniques using the different expertise in these different labs,\" Sun said. \"That will give us a solid foundation for the initiative, and then we will move on to more complex protein samples.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nCHICAGO â€“ In reporting its quarterly financial results for the first time since it went public in July, Sophia Genetics also announced or further detailed a series of deals with the likes of Weill Cornell Medicine, Agilent Technologies, and Brazilian molecular diagnostics firmÂ\\xa0Dasa.\\nSophia said Thursday that its second quarter revenue grew 72 percent year over year to $10.2 million from $5.9 million a year earlier when the company was privately held. For the three months ended June 30, Sophia\\'s net loss more than doubled year over year to $18.4 million, or $.38 per share, from $7.9 million, or $.20 per share.\\nThe company also confirmed that it raised an additional $20 million from a private placement by GE Healthcare shortly after its initial public offering closed. The IPO grossed $234 million, netted $217 million, and valued Sophia at $1.14 billion.\\nCEO and Founder Jurgi Camblong told GenomeWeb in July that that the firm had not changed its growth and R&D strategy in the wake of the IPO.\\nThat includes pushing beyond Sophia\\'s historical market of academic medical centers into community hospitals and, eventually, oncology clinics, as well as expanding to new modalities, such as a pending agreement with GE Healthcare to build on GE Healthcare\\'s medical imaging and monitoring technologies and Edison data aggregation platform, as well as Sophia\\'s flagship DDM platform. GE Healthcare and Sophia have said that they hope to break down data silos between imaging instruments and care sites that hinder the deployment of true precision cancer care.\\nCamblong said this week that Sophia and GE Healthcare should have a formal agreement by the end of the year.\\nSophia, which has twin headquarters in Saint-Sulpice, Switzerland and Boston, also reported that its customer base grew to 780 customers at the end of Q2, up from 750 in Q1. A new user during the most recent quarter is Weill Cornell.\\nCamblong said that the New York-based institution is typical of customers Sophia has had before, a large academic institution. He said that Weill Cornell initially is using Sophia\\'s core genomic analytics platform called Data Driven Medicine, or DDM,Â\\xa0to identify and classify genetic variants.\\nThrough DDM, Sophia supports analytics pipelinesÂ\\xa0and builds components includingÂ\\xa0artificial intelligence technology for predicting variant pathogenicity.\\n\"We are starting on applications from cancer [with Weill Cornell], but this might go beyond cancer,\" Camblong said.\\nThis is a strategy, popular in the technology industry in general, called \"land and expand\" that Sophia has successfully employed with other customers, according to Camblong. Customers often have an initial need and use case for DDM. \"As they adopt our platform, they tend to increase the menu of applications that they are going to use,\" he said.\\n\"We have many customers that may start, with, say, solid tumor needs and then would adopt our platform as well for liquid tumors or hematology applications and maybe some hereditary cancer applications,\" Camblong explained. \"As we gain trust in our technological capabilities, they tend to move [many] things into our platform.\"\\nSophia also discussed an agreement with Agilent Technologies to comarket technology to automate library prep and analytics processes for next-generation sequencing. \\nSophia has another collaboration with Agilent, disclosed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing in July, to codevelop a diagnostic product that will be compatible with Agilent\\'s Magnis SureSelect assays. According to that document, the companies signed a two-year, nonexclusive agreement in December that contains \"potential successiveÂ\\xa0one-yearÂ\\xa0renewal options.\"\\nCamblong said that the new automation agreement centers around a forthcoming comprehensive genomic profiling assay from Agilent. Sophia technology will help Agilent customers pull more accurate data out of those diagnostic tests, he said. \\n\"Our mission is â€¦ breaking data silos across instruments, across modalities, across institutions to bring light to the data and provide the best possible insights,\" Camblong added.\\nAlso during the earnings call, Camblong mentioned the expansion of an existing partnership withÂ\\xa0Dasa, announced two weeks ago. The companies, which have been working together since 2016, agreed toÂ\\xa0createÂ\\xa0aÂ\\xa0decentralizedÂ\\xa0homologous recombination deficiencyÂ\\xa0(HRD) analytics system.\\nCamblong noted that Dasa products and services touch 20 million patients, mostly in South America. He said that the expansion will help Dasa gain a greater foothold in other markets, particularly the US. \"This partnership represents pretty well what we can do with any specialty lab, any centralized lab around the world,\" he said. \\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ Research from Strata Oncology on a large cohort of cancer patients has shown that the firm\\'s amplification-based sequencing assay can handle samples that don\\'t meet the usual requirements for comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP).\\nThe company also believes that assays like StrataNGS that only need little tumor tissue could help overcome roadblocks to broad and equitable implementation of precision oncology.\\nPublished in JCO Precision Oncology last month, the company\\'s study analyzed more than 32,000 consecutive tumor tissue samples received for StrataNGS testing as part of the Strata Trial.\\nStrataNGS is a 429-gene assay performed on RNA and DNA from the same sample. It reports out single nucleotide variants, indels, copy number alteration, microsatellite instability status, gene fusions, and tumor mutational burden and wasÂ\\xa0validated in another recent studyÂ\\xa0in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics.\\n\"When we came together to start Strata, we were really focused on a core belief that every patient with advanced cancer deserves to know if their tumor has an actionable alteration,\" said Scott Tomlins, Strata\\'s chief medical officer. \\nAt that time, neither Medicare nor private insurers covered tests like Strata\\'s. This has now changed, but even though, \"there are still many patients that are eligible that aren\\'t getting it today,\" he said. \\nThe company\\'s strategy has been to partner with healthcare systems and pharma firms to provide CGP \"at scale,\" Tomlins said. \"It doesn\\'t work to try to just go convince every doctor that they should do this [and] you also have to efficiently utilize the data that you\\'re getting back, learn from that data, and bring novel precision medicine trials [that you can deliver] locally.\"\\nThis was the genesis of the Strata trial: an observational study of the company\\'s commercially tested patient cohort, tracking the impact of testing on treatment selection, clinical trial enrollment, and outcomes.\\n\"It wasn\\'t prespecified, but this question of sample availability and the characteristics of the sample â€” whether that is part of the reason that people aren\\'t getting CGP â€” is actually challenging to establish, so we thought that we could use the Strata trial to try,\" Tomlins said.\\nIn their JCO publication, the researchers analyzed records of about 32,000 samples received consecutively for clinical sequencing and reporting during the trial.\\nFor 94 percent of the 31,165 tested specimens, Strata was able to successfully generate sequence data and report results. This was despite the fact that about 11 percent of submitted samples had tumor content of less than 20 percent. \\nMeanwhile, 58 percent of samples were classified as \"small,\" having less than 25 mm2 of tumor surface area, which the authors cited as the minimum requirement for some of the leading commercial hybrid capture-based CGP tests, Strata\\'s competitors, in the growing precision oncology market.\\nClinical researchers have identified multiple factors that reduceÂ\\xa0advanced cancer patients\\' access to genomic testing, including physician skepticism, financial or payor challenges, and disparities in healthcare, in addition to turnaround time and sample adequacy issues. But according to Tomlins, tissue availability is one of the largest obstacles to widespread use of CGP.\\n\"When you talk about how well your test works, it matters what samples were sent to you. We set the limit of two mm2 â€¦ but we received a lot that were smaller than that, which reflects the fact thatÂ\\xa0many samples that are available in real-world healthcare systems are small and challenging to test,\" he said. \\n\"A laboratory may say its tests work 99 percent of the time, but you don\\'t know what was sent to them. You also don\\'t know what wasn\\'t sent to them,\" Tomlins added. \"In my experience, clinicians quickly realized that if they sent five samples to a laboratory and they get five not-sufficient results back, they will stop sending those kinds of samples, so it may look like the laboratory has a very high success rate but it\\'s just they\\'re not getting the difficult samples anymore.\"\\nAccording to Tomlins, Strata\\'s ability to glean results from tiny samples is reflective of both its test technology and its streamlining of bioinformatic and other processes. As described in the JMD paper, the StrataNGS assay uses multiplexed PCR-based library preparation and IonTorrent sequencing, a choice that he said reflects his and Strata CEO Dan Rhodes\\' prior experience with the platform.\\n\"We were comfortable with this technology and knew its ability to generate results from the most challenging samples. But then we also really had to optimize every single step â€¦ from receiving the sample, evaluating it under the microscope, isolating DNA and RNA, and preparing the library, using a fairly complex, multi-panel approach that we designed to really be able to get the absolute most impactful information out of even the most challenging samples.\"\\nThe company also developed and optimized every step of the bioinformatics process in house, he added. Testing samples below the company\\'s stated minimum tumor content criteria requires robust processes and \"back-end review,\" he said, to separate signal from noise and determine if the sample did not work. \\nMark Burkard, a medical oncologist in the University of Wisconsin health system, said in an email that while the issue of sample availability varies by cancer type and where a biopsy was taken, it is well recognized.\\nHe said that UW Health currently has a goal of routine comprehensive NGS testing for all advanced cancer patients with solid tumors, a program that grew as physicians saw its positive impact in the fraction patients who benefitted from targeted and investigational therapies. \\n\"I would estimate that a quarter to a third of samples may be inadequate based on the requirement for standard NGS tests,\" Burkard wrote. That doesn\\'t mean a patient cannot have their tumor sequenced though, he added. \"If we determine they are inadequate up front, we notify the physician, repeat the biopsy, or get a liquid biopsy test.\"\\nBut even though these fallbacks are in place, the fact of a small or otherwise challenging sample is still an issue, Burkard said.\\nA number of patients travel long distances for their care and are reached through outreach sites, he said. Most have archived diagnostic biopsies available, which were often obtained with procedures such as lung biopsy or bronchoscopy that carry risks from sedation or pneumothorax. \"If we can use their initial biopsy, it saves them the difficulty of time, travel, and risk of procedure,\" he said.\\nAlthough he could not cite specific cases, Burkard said he and his colleagues have certainly seen a number of patients with adequate biopsies for StrataNGS that they believe would have been inadequate for other technologies.\\nThe authors of the JCO study cautioned that they didn\\'t make any direct comparisons with other available CGP tests, so any implication that Strata\\'s lower sample requirements lead to improved results is hypothetical. \\nIn practice, while other tissue NGS tests list higher tumor requirements, companies have strategies they can employ to avoid test failures if customers submit a sub-optimal sample. For example, Caris Life Sciences lists a tumor content requirement of 25 mm2 surface area and at least 20 percent tumor nuclei. But it says that, when necessary, it can microdissect specimens with less than 20 percent cancer cells to enable higher-quality testing.\\nSequencing firms can also do what Strata did in the trial â€” attempt to sequence sub-optimal samples and use bioinformatic methods to determine if the results are reliable.\\n\"I think a lot of times, knowing what somebody says their minimum requirements are â€¦ doesn\\'t really mean anything until you see what their experience is,\" Tomlins said. \"So with this study, I think we wanted to sort of say, \\'here\\'s our experience,\\' and I think that establishes a framework for other laboratories.\" \\n\"I think the key thing that we saw is that if you have requirements of 25 mm2, that the majority of samples in the real world don\\'t meet that requirement,\" he said, \"which makes sense when you see clinical trials where you have to account for every sample sent in and [success rates] look so dismal, with NGS failing 30 percent or 50 percent of the time.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nThis story has been updated to include comments from a patent law expert and to correct patent expiration dates.\\nNEW YORK â€“ A Federal Court judge has ruled that BGI\\'s StandardMPS and CoolMPS products infringe several Illumina patents. \\nIn an order issued Thursday, Judge William Orrick of the US District Court for the Northern District of California awarded Illumina\\'s request for summary judgement on those issues and also rebuffed BGI\\'s counterclaim that Illumina infringed its US Patent No. 9,944,984, \"Methods and Compositions for Efficient Base Calling in Sequencing Reactions.\" \\nIllumina\\'s allegations of infringement \"are not rebutted by BGI\\'s expert opinions and BGI\\'s counsel confirmed that its experts did not serve reports on these issues,\" Orrick wrote. \"BGI does not contend that there is a genuine issue of material fact. BGI only asserts that Illumina failed to show there were no disputed issues of fact and that these issues are best addressed during the preparation of pre-trial submissions. I disagree and grant summary judgment in favor of Illumina.\" \\nRegarding the BGI countersuit, the judge wrote that \"because all of BGI\\'s infringement theories rely on a flawed opinion that the accused dsDNA contain multiple copies of one single DNA sequence, there is no evidence that Illumina\\'s Accused Products infringe the \\'984 Patent.\"\\n\"It\\'s a pretty major victory for Illumina,\" said Jacob Sherkow, a patent law expert and professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. \"At least in the near term, it should continue to entrench Illumina\\'s market position in the US, relative to BGI and its affiliates.\" \\n\"While we respectÂ\\xa0the court\\'s decision, we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property, as we have in other jurisdictions, and strive for choice in the market. We willÂ\\xa0continue to do our utmost to protect the interests of our customers, research collaborators, and business partners,\" BGI said in a statement. \"We have a robust patent portfolio in the field of gene sequencing, and we will continue to defend our intellectual property assets on a global scale.\"\\nIlluminaÂ\\xa0did not immediately respond to a requestÂ\\xa0for comment. \\nIllumina has sued BGI several times in the US to keep the Chinese company from launching its products there. Illumina began in 2019 by alleging that BGI\\'s StandardMPS sequencing method infringed its US Patents Nos. 7,566,537 and 9,410,200. In early 2020, Illumina sued again, alleging that BGI\\'s CoolMPS reagents, introduced just a few days earlier, infringed its US Patent Nos. 7,541,444 and 7,771,973, both titled \"Modified nucleotides,\" and its US Patent No. 10,480,025, titled \"Labeled nucleotides.\"\\nIn these cases, Illumina has successfully obtained a preliminary injunction preventing BGI and its affiliates from marketing their sequencing platforms in the US. \\nBGI affiliate Complete Genomics has sued Illumina, alleging patent infringement of its two-color sequencing technology.\\nHaving a judge issue summary judgment in patent infringement cases is common, Sherkow said; however, \"the way in which summary judgement was granted in favor of Illumina is pretty uncommon.\" \\n\"It seems like it was granted simply because BGI didn\\'t put up a robust enough defense,\" he said,Â\\xa0suggestingÂ\\xa0that there may be \"some strategic consideration behind doing this.\" \\nAccording to Illumina, the \\'973 patent will expire August 2022Â\\xa0and the \\'444 patent in June 2023.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'C': '<p><span><span>The firm recently kicked off a study to determine whether a set of RNA-expression biomarkers can provide a high negative predictive value to rule out sepsis. </span></span></p>',\n",
              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â”€ Presymptom Health believes a multimarker blood test it is currently evaluating in a clinical study could detect sepsis a few days before a patient develops symptoms, far earlier than current tests.\\nTo detect signatures of a dysregulated host response to infection, the Wiltshire, UK-based startup is developing an RNA-expression test for PCR platforms used in hospital laboratories.\\nThe firm, established in 2019, recently closed a seed round of financing to support development of the test, taking its total raised since early 2020 to almost Â£1 millionÂ\\xa0($1.4 million).\\nPresymptom Health\\'s test leverages a set of RNA-expression biomarkers to predict \"the likelihood of clinical sepsis within three days\" after a test has been administered, the company\\'s CEO Iain Miller said in an interview. \"The main clinical decision we want to support is whether a patient needs to be admitted to the hospital or can safely be released.\"\\nIf the company\\'s plans materialize, the sepsis test could be in the market around the second quarter of 2023, Miller said, adding that its current focus is on developing an assay that would run on PCR platforms in hospital laboratories connected with emergency departments.\\n\"Ultimately, we\\'re trying to flag patients with the highest risk of deterioration from an infection, at a time when they may not experience symptoms,\" Miller said. \"Though we need to prove it, our hope is that the test\\'s negative predictive value will be high enough that it can be used to rule out a progression to sepsis.\" \\nHe said that internal studies are promising and indicate that its combinations of biomarkers can have a negative predictive value in the high 90s.\\nIn May, Presymptom Health kicked off a UK-based multisite study to validate the performance of the markers and its sepsis test in a follow-on clinical study. Study researchers are evaluating the performance of a panel of 47 RNA-expression markers, and plan to incorporate up to 10 of the best performing markers in the sepsis test. \\nMiller said that with clinical researchers, the company plans to recruit up to 600 patients that are entering emergency departments and being admitted to the hospital at four clinical sites. The investigators are drawing blood from the patients upon their admission to hospital and each day thereafter while the patient is still in the hospital, and then testing each blood sample to compare the panel\\'s predictions with patient health outcomes.\\nPatients with and without COVID-19 are being enrolled, Miller said. \\n\"A lot of people present with bacterial infections to emergency departments, but we are pointedly recruiting about a third of patients with suspected viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2,\" he said, adding that among their objectives the researchers are evaluating whether the test can predict the severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk that a patient with SARS-CoV-2 will progress to sepsis. \\nPresymptom\\'s target date to complete the validation study is early next summer.\\nThe firm has outsourced prototype development and sample analyses for the study to BioXpedia, an Aarhus, Denmark-based contract research laboratory that had worked on the earlier biomarker discovery study for the sepsis test.\\nThat study was managed by the UK Ministry of Defence\\'s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and had about Â£16 millionÂ\\xa0in funding from the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency, UK Ministry of Defence, UK Home Office, and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).\\nThe study ran for 10 years and recruited 4,400 individuals in eight hospitals â”€ seven in the UK and one in Germany. To find individuals who were asymptomatic but had the potential to get an infection, the researchers recruited patients undergoing primarily abdominal surgeries, and collected blood samples from them prior to surgery, after surgery, and each day for the following week. Blood samples from patients who quickly developed symptoms of infection and progressed to sepsis provided the basis for discovery of its gene-expression signatures.\\nTo develop the signatures, researchers at the University of Jena in Germany used machine learning to evaluate transcriptomic and proteomic results obtained from microarray and PCR testing of the blood samples. \\nWhen the study was completed in 2017, Presymptom licensed the technology for its test from DSTL. Miller noted that within the group of 47 genes selected by the researchers, one multi-gene signature among several is expected to become part of its early sepsis detection test. \\nFast detection\\nFast detection is needed for bloodstream infections such as sepsis given a high patient mortality rate that rises significantly with each passing hour. Current tests use a variety of technologies to detect pathogens associated with disease or to analyze a patient\\'s immune response.\\nSeveral US Food and Drug Administration-cleared procalcitonin tests are on the US market, including from Roche, BioMÃ©rieux, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Producers of highly multiplexed tests that detect sepsis bloodstream pathogens include Roche\\'s GenMark Diagnostics and BioMÃ©rieux\\'s BioFire. And this year, Tucson, Arizona-based Accelerate Diagnostics plans to target customers with a new IVD configuration of its PhenoTest BC kit that addresses the antimicrobial susceptibility testing needs of laboratories that have rapid identification for bloodstream infections already in place.\\nAmong the IVD competitors with current tests in the market, only Lexington, Massachusetts-based T2 Biosystems has a test that operates without requiring a blood culture â”€ a lengthy process that significantly slows the time to detect bloodstream infections such as sepsis. According to T2, its FDA-cleared T2Bacteria Panel and T2Candida panels detect sepsis-causing pathogens in whole blood in three to five hours.\\nHost response tests, which Presymptom Health is developing, also do not require a blood culture. Lumos Diagnostics\\' FebriDx test, which is currently on the market, is a single-use host-response assay for detecting and differentiating viral and bacterial infections in 10 minutes.\\nInflammatix is developing HostDx Sepsis, a host-response RNA-expression test to detect and differentiate bacterial from viral infections in patients presenting with fever to hospital emergency departments, and Predigen Diagnostics is developing a multiplex platform that uses host gene expression signatures as a basis for the prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic monitoring systems.\\nMiller said that Presymptom\\'s test would differentiate itself in the sepsis testing market because it seeks to detect sepsis infections earlier than current tests.\\nIts test, if it can be commercialized, will include a reagent kit and software patch supplied by Presymptom for current laboratory PCR machines, Miller said. The software patch is needed to apply a formula to expression levels derived from testing, and calculate a number representative of the level of patient risk, he said.\\nIn addition to requirements to validate the test\\'s performance, the firm will need to obtain regulatory clearances and raise capital to support ongoing test development. \"It\\'s unlikely we would take this test all the way to the market,\" Miller said, adding that the firm will probably look to collaborate with an IVD industry partner to obtain regulatory clearances and launch the test.\\nGiven uncertainty around the implementation of new IVD regulations in Europe, Presymptom may look to launch it in the UK with a new UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark, Miller said.\\nNew European IVD Regulations are expected to come into effect on May 26, 2022, but most experts agree that notified bodies do not have the capacity to assess all the IVDs that are currently on the market.\\nMeanwhile, UKCA marking â”€ used for products being placed on the market in England, Wales, and Scotland â”€ became effective at the beginning of this year. \\nIf Presymptom is successful in its plans to commercialize a lab test, it expects to also leverage protein biomarkers uncovered during the 10-year study to develop a point-of-care assay for early sepsis detection. The company may opt to develop a lateral flow strip using selected protein biomarkers, or look to partner with a point-of-care platform manufacturer, Miller said.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ A team of US researchers led by the Broad Institute\\'s Feng Zhang has discovered a new class of transposon-encoded RNA-guided DNA nucleases, which they said could be used for genome editing in human cells and hold potential for biotechnology.\\nIn a paper published on Thursday in Science, the researchers wrote that the IscB proteins â€” which are the likely ancestors of the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 â€” are putative nucleases encoded in a distinct family of IS200/IS605 transposons. Using evolutionary analysis, RNA-seq, and biochemical experiments, they reconstructed the evolution of CRISPR-Cas9 systems from IS200/IS605 transposons and showed that IscB utilized a single non-coding RNA for RNA-guided cleavage of double-stranded DNA.\\nThe researchers also experimented with the RNA-guided nuclease activity of TnpB, another IS200/605 transposon-encoded protein and the likely ancestor of Cas12 endonucleases. Overall, they said, this work revealed a widespread class of transposon-encoded RNA-guided nucleases, which they named OMEGA, for Obligate Mobile Element Guided Activity.\\nIscB is about 400 amino acids long and has an architecture similar to that of Cas9 â€” it contains an RuvC endonuclease domain split by the insertion of a bridge helix as well as an HNH endonuclease domain. When the researchers performed a comprehensive search for proteins containing an HNH or a split RuvC endonuclease domain, they found that Cas9 and IscB were the only proteins that contained both domains. Clustering and phylogenetic analyses of the combined RuvC, BH, and HNH domains strongly suggested that all extant Cas9s descended from a single ancestral IscB. \\nUsing a previously established protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-discovery assay, they further observed that CRISPR-associated IscBs are reprogrammable RNA-guided nucleases. Additional experiments showed that IscB functionally associated with CRISPR at least once, and likely on additional occasions, suggesting that IscB systems more generally shared a core ancestral ncRNA gene that was prone to evolving into a CRISPR array or a separate trans-acting tracrRNA. \\nThe researchers also investigated the evolutionary relationships between IscB, Cas9, and other homologous proteins to gain a broader insight into the evolution of RNA-guided mechanisms. In searching for proteins containing split RuvC domains, they detected another group of shorter IscB homologs that were about 350 amino acids long and were also encoded in IS200/605 superfamily transposons. They renamed these proteins IsrB (Insertion sequence RuvC-like OrfB). \\nIn addition to IscB and IsrB, they further identified a family of even smaller (about 180 amino acids) proteins that only contained the PLMP domain and HNH domain but no RuvC domain, which they named IshB (Insertion sequence HNH-like OrfB).\\nIn investigating the relationships between these proteins, they found that IsrB, IscB, and Cas9 formed distinct, strongly supported clades, suggesting that each of these nucleases originated from a unique evolutionary event. Additionally, they were able to identify two distinct groups of Cas9s. The first was a new subtype called II-D â€” a group of relatively small Cas9s about 700 amino acids long that are not associated with any other known cas genes. The second is a distinct clade branching from within the II-C subtype, which includes exceptionally large Cas9s (more than 1,700 amino acids) that are associated with tnpA. \\n\"Through the exploration of Cas9 evolution, we discovered the programmable RNA-guided mechanism of three highly abundant but previously uncharacterized transposon-encoded nucleases: IscB, IsrB, and TnpB, which we collectively refer to as OMEGA â€¦ because the mobile element localization and movement likely determines the identity of their guides,\" the authors concluded. \"Although the biological functions of [OMEGA] systems remain unknown, several hypotheses are compatible with the available evidence, including roles in facilitating TnpA-catalyzed, RNA-guided transposition, or acting as a toxin.\"\\nThey further noted that the TnpB family is far more abundant and diverse than the IscB family, and that TnpBs might represent a vast diversity of RNA-guided mechanisms present not only in prokaryotes, but also in eukaryotes.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nCHICAGO â€“ Molecular diagnostics company Invivoscribe is branching out into bioinformatics by hiring its first-ever chief information officer and introducing a new bioinformatics platform. \\nSan Diego-based Invivoscribe last week debuted its commercial version of LymphoTrack, an enterprise pipeline management system for high-volume clinical molecular laboratories to access raw sequencing data, mine data from CDR3 â€” a key T-cell receptor region for measuring clonal expansion in leukemia â€” and interpret results through visualization. \\nLymphoTrack is currently only compatible with Illumina MiSeq instruments, but the firm will soon introduce B-cell MRD clonality and MyMRD-myeloid assays through its international LabPMM network for Illumina NextSeq 550Dx and NovaSeq sequencers. Invivoscribe said that the two MRD services will be available for research studies by the end of the year and that the company expects CAP/CLIA accreditation for the assays in early 2022.\\nTony Lialin, the company\\'sÂ\\xa0chief commercial officer,Â\\xa0said that in general, Invivoscribe\\'s technology is \"platform-agnostic,\" since the company has kits that run on Thermo Fisher Scientific Ion Torrent sequencing, as well as on capillary electrophoresis instruments. \\nLymphoTrack represents the commercialization of bioinformatics technology the company had developed for managing its own internal pipelines. Lialin called software \"a hugely undervalued asset at Invivoscribe.\"\\nLialin joined Invivoscribe in March after serving as CCO of Loop Genomics for three years. Earlier, he helped found Silicon Genetics and BlueGnome, informatics-focused companies that were acquired by Agilent Technologies and Illumina, respectively. \\nWhen he came on board at Invivoscribe, Lialin \"saw a ton of software that we can potentially commercialize [and] productize that would add value to what our customers are doing,\" he said this month.\\n\"We were just looking at what we have and asking the question if we\\'ve developed all these processes internally to help us get to the answer, why don\\'t we do this for our customers? It just makes sense,\" Lialin said.\\n\"I really think there\\'s a lot of value through informatics, and I always gravitate towards it,\" Lialin added. To him, bioinformatics software can alleviate bottlenecks in both collecting clinical samples and in analyzing the data from molecular lab tests. \\n\"If we have tools that can assist our customers, why not get them out there into their hands?\" Lialin said.\\nThe company plans on further automating pipelines by adding artificial intelligence and machine learning to its software. That is the wheelhouse of Meindert Niemeijer, chief information officer, who joined Invivoscribe at the beginning of last week after working in R&D at Coralville, Iowa-based Digital Diagnostics, an AI-based medical diagnostics company.\\nAt Digital Diagnostics, Niemeijer worked in a hybrid environment where software was both embedded in medical devices and hosted in the cloud. He said that he would like to investigate more cloud deployments for Invivoscribe software. \\n\"I think it really is important for us to take a good look at that data and see what value we can derive from that,\" Niemeijer said. \"Whenever you have people looking at complex data for a long amount of time, those are the kind of areas that are really ripe for â€¦ AI.\"\\nLialin said that Invivoscribe has generated more data this year than in the entire 25-year history of the company prior to 2021.\\nThe company has had a software development team for several years, building Java-based apps for desktop computers for specific clinical trials or to bundle with companion diagnostics. \"It allows people to bring data in at a small scale and click through and get results,\" Lialin said.\\nUntil now, though, Invivoscribe has lacked software for high-throughput environments. It certainly did not have a comprehensive informatics strategy that would necessitate the hiring of a CIO.\\nLialin said that smaller hospitals might be drawn to the older desktop software while comprehensive cancer centers and reference labs would opt for the pipeline version, LymphoTrack.\\nIn introducing LymphoTrack, Invivoscribe named Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York, as an early customer. \\n\"Clinical labs need to be able to analyze large amounts of clonality and MRD data quickly and easily. Current bioinformatics software generally requires that technicians click through software to analyze data one patient at a time; this is both tedious and prone to human errors,\" Sean Glenn of Roswell Park\\'s Center for Personalized Medicine, said in a statement provided by Invivoscribe. LymphoTrack is designed to address that problem.\\nWhile Lialin said that Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, and the Stanford Cancer Institute have used Invivoscribe\\'s bioinformatics to automate their pipelines, Roswell Park is the first to adopt the production version of LymphoTrack, which was built in Docker, a development platform for containerizing applications.\\nLialin explained that the containerized approach allows end users to plug the software right into their pipelines and start running standardized analyses with minimal setup. \"That\\'s exactly what this software package is about at Roswell Park,\" he said. \"I see this as a strategy to take a lot of the desktop tools that we have and to make them high-value, high-throughput informatics tools.\"\\nThe Docker version of LymphoTrack is for research use only. Lialin said that Invivoscribe will not need regulatory review for the software, but end users that want to include the technology in a laboratory-developed diagnostic test will need to seek approval.\\nInvivoscribe has built up a large storehouse of data from samples sent in by clients over the years. The company historically has focused on hematological malignancies, though Lialin said that Invivoscribe is diversifying into solid tumors as well. He added that there are some \"early projects\" in the works outside of cancer entirely, specifically mentioning celiac disease.\\n\"There are a broad number of areas and platforms that we can go after, and we\\'re going to leverage our internal ability to procure samples as well as route and analyze those to have best-in-class software for our customers and our partners,\" Lialin said.\\nLialin said that Invivoscribe will try to integrate bioinformatics with other lab services like the 12-color multiparametric flow cytometry the firm introduced in June. \\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€” An international team of researchers has examined how variations in sequencing approaches can influence the ability to accurately detect cancer mutations, providing guidance for the wider community. The team additionally developed a set of reference samples for benchmarking efforts.\\nNext-generation sequencing approaches are increasingly being adopted to analyze clinical samples, and being able to accurately detect somatic mutations and distinguish cancer-specific variants from analytical errors is needed to implement precision oncology approaches. But most previous analyses have focused on particular aspects of somatic variant calling in isolation, rather than the entire process.\\nInstead, researchers led by Leming Shi at Fudan University and Charles Wang at Loma Linda University School of Medicine examined the process in full. They found that read coverage and variant callers influence whole-genome sequencing reproducibility, while those and other factors affect whole-exome sequencing reproducibility. In a related paper, the researchers also established a set of reference call sets that can be used to benchmark somatic mutation calling approaches.\\n\"We observed that each component of the sequencing and analysis process can affect the final outcome,\" Shi, Wang, and their colleagues wrote in their paper.\\nAs they reported Thursday in Nature Biotechnology, the researchers used a range of different, real-world approaches to call somatic variants in a matched pair of breast cancer and normal cell lines. They sequenced the cell lines at six centers using three different sequencing platforms for whole-genome sequencing and three Illumina HiSeq models for whole-exome sequencing. \\nThey noted some differences between the centers due to variations in strategy. Choice of library preparation kit, for instance, influenced the average percentage of mapped reads.\\nThey additionally applied three different mutation callers to alignments generated by three different aligners. While there were no noticeable differences between the aligners on exome data, that was not the case for whole-genome data. Bowtie2, they noted, appeared to be more conservative than the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Aligner or Novoalign. After fixing the alignment to BWA, the researchers examined the callers using an O-score that measures the reproducibility of repeated runs. Through this, they found Strelka2 had the best reproducibility in whole-genome sequencing runs but was the worst in exome runs, where MuTect2 instead had the best reproducibility. \\nThey further examined which variables within the analysis process â€” not just caller choice, but also machine model, read coverage, G/C content, and more â€” contributed to O-score variation. Overall, read coverage and callers had the greatest effect on whole-genome sequencing run reproducibility, while additional factors like insert fragment size, G/C content, and global imbalance or GIV score â€” a measure of DNA damage â€” as well as their interactions, affected exome run reproducibility.\\nIn a related study, also in appearing in Nature Biotechnology, the researchers generated reference samples and call sets specifically for benchmarking somatic variant calls, noting that existing sets are for germline mutation detection. For this, they sequenced the genomes of a breast cancer cell line and a matched lymphoblastoid cell line using a range of short-read sequencing platforms at seven centers. \\nThey generated calls from 21 replicates using three aligners and six mutation callers, which they then combined and assigned a confidence level. In all, the somatic reference call set includes 2.48 billion base pairs.\\nThey then validated the call set by mixing tumor and normal cell lines at different proportions prior to sequencing. Overall, they achieved 99.93 percent and 97.5 percent validation rates for SNVs or indels in the high confidence and medium confidence sets, respectively. PacBio long-read sequencing further confirmed 99.3 percent of the SNVs and 98.5 percent of the indels in the high-confidence set.\\nAccording to the researchers, this call set can be used to evaluate next-generation sequencing pipelines, adding that the genomic DNA samples they used have been preserved and could be used to develop standard reference materials.\\nShi, Wang, and their colleagues additionally made a set of recommendations for detecting cancer mutations via next-generation sequencing in their reproducibility study. For example, they suggested certain read coverage levels for varying levels of tumor content, both for whole-genome and whole-exome analyses, as well as when different mutations callers might best serve users.\\n\"Detection of cancer mutations is an integrated process,\" they added. \"No individual component can be singled out in isolation as being more important than any other, and specific components affect and interact with each other.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

While the falling costs of next-generation sequencing have led to a rise in the technology\\'s use in the clinic, no bulk sequencing study has yet addressed the effects of cross-site reproducibility or weighed the biological, technical, and computational factors that influence variant identification. An international team led by scientists from the US Food and Drug Administration and Fudan University interrogated somatic mutations in paired tumor/normal cell lines to identify factors affecting detection reproducibility and accuracy at six different centers. Using both whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing, the investigators evaluated the reproducibility of different sample types with varying input amounts, tumor purity, and multiple library construction protocols, followed by processing with nine bioinformatics pipelines. They find that read coverage and callers affected both WGS and WES reproducibility, but WES performance was influenced by insert fragment size, genomic copy content, and the global imbalance score. \"Because these samples were prepared from a pair of well-characterized, renewable tumor/normal cell lines from the same donor, our results can serve as a reference for the NGS research community when performing benchmarking studies for the development of new NGS products, assays, and informatics tools,\" the study\\'s authors write.

Most of the Huo-Yan labs are operated by local public health departments or local authorities, although some have been commissioned by BGI, he added. BGI Genomics provides the training and technical support services for the lab, but the actual testing program is determined by the public health department, he said. \\nThey largely perform PCR testing, with a small amount of antigen testing, and mostly use SARS-CoV-2 tests developed by BGI, according to Li. Those tests include virus sequencing assays; nucleic acid detection assays; rapid nucleic acid, antibody, and antigen tests; and neutralizing antibody assays; as well as multiplex assays for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, he said.\\nSo far, more than 90 Huo-Yan labs have been established in 30 countries with a maximum daily testing capacity of 1 million tests, Li said. \\nHe added that BGI is ready to work with local authorities to expand the diseases and pathogens being tested for in these labs, although he noted that it\\'s up to the authorities what those expansions look like. \"The transformation of BGI\\'s COVID-19 testing [business] into regular business has begun to take shape,\" Li said.\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€“ A genomic analysis tool often used to find new ways to treat cancer is finding new use in the search for more COVID-19 treatments. \\nGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method of identifying the genes most likely to functionally associate with a given cellular state, such as disease, developmental stage, or drug response. \\nBy working with sets instead of individual genes, GSEA provides a more robust picture of how cells respond to various conditions. This network-level approach lends itself easily to drug repositioning studies, in which scientists seek new uses for currently approved medicines.\\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an uptick in such studies. Their increase, measured by the number of papers per year matching \"drug repositioning\" in the PubMed database, roughly doubled between 2020 and this year, compared to the annual change from 2017 to 2020.\\nWhile an exact count of the number of these studies relying upon GSEA and the tools that it has enabled was less clear, these methodologies certainly underlie many of them. \\nThe underlying logic of GSEA is that differences between cells, whether different types of cells or cells in different states of disease and health, can be described by unique patterns of gene expression. \\nThe most differentially expressed genes â€” those most and least expressed â€” are the ones most likely to play a significant role in maintaining a given cellular state. It follows from this that by reversing that gene \"signature,\" such as one related to cancer, could push those cells back into a healthy state. \\nThis methodology plays a significant role in drug repositioning because it shifts the focus from the singular molecular targets of a given drug to the network effect that a drug can have based on its mechanism of action (MoA). \\nGideon Bosker, the CEO and cofounder of DarwinHealth, a bioinformatics company focused on drug repositioning, describes these as \"field effects,\" acting upon diverse cellular targets. \\n\"A systems approach to deconvoluting the field effect â€” what previously might have been called off target effects â€” may be a much more effective way of determining a drug\\'s final application to a particular therapy or biological question,\" Bosker stated.\\n\"Repurposing drugs is just a way of understanding that drugs by definition have not been preordained to only do one thing,\" he added.\\nDarwinHealth recently adapted its signature DarwinOncoTreat tool, which matches FDA-approved drugs to druggable cancer-related targets, to finding a slate of potential new COVID-19 therapies. \\nDarwinOncoTreat builds upon GSEA analysis by inferring the activity of \"master regulators\" â€” key proteins that control genetic programs underlying transcriptional cellular states â€” from the differential enrichment of their transcriptional targets in disease-relevant gene expression profiles.\\nThe company\\'s VIPER algorithm then prioritizes drugs whose MoA can abolish the disease-causing regulatory programs that these master regulators control.\\nDarwinHealth has applied this approach to various tumor subtypes and its proprietary technology is currently being deployed in seven clinical trials evaluating repositioned drugs across a spectrum of cancers.\\nIn a pre-print of a study currently under review, scientists from DarwinHealth, along with academic collaborators at Columbia University, used an adapted version of this tool, dubbed ViroTreat, to identify drugs potentially capable of treating COVID-19. \\nTheir analysis showed a set of differentially regulated genes, some related to cellular regulatory programs involved in promoting viral replication and others in activating host immune response, along with a list of possible medications for targeting these genes, either to impede viral replication or help boost the immune response. \\nEncouragingly, several of the drugs they identified in this unbiased manner have also emerged as potential anti-viral medications in separate studies.\\nDarwinHealth plans to follow up this proof-of-concept study with validation studies in physiologic models. \\nOther GSEA-based studies have applied similar strategies to the task of finding COVID-19 treatments.\\nIn one, researchers used GSEA to identify upstream regulatory elements of proteases known to facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 â€” the virus causing COVID-19 â€” into host cells. They discovered that estradiol and retinoic acid, two FDA-approved medications, could potentially help treat COVID-19 by modulating the activity of several regulators of those virus-associated proteases. Importantly, this finding agrees with at least two other studies that noted potential therapeutic effects of estradiol and retinoic acid in treating COVID-19 patients. \\nAnother study also employing GSEA in combination with other network biology tools such as weighted correlation network analysis, identified another set of potential COVID-19 therapies, including the TNF-alpha inhibitor entanercept and the GABABR agonist baclofen.\\nImportantly, real-world data from case studies support these predictions.\\nIn one study that employed the basic idea of a drug\\'s network effect without computational methods â€” essentially performing a proof-of-concept of the more unbiased GSEA-based approach to drug repositioning â€” a Chinese group predicted that etanercept might treat COVID-19 because of the similarity between inflammatory cytokine activities in toxic epidermal necrolysis and COVID-19.\\nIt is worth noting that despite advances being made in drug repositioning efforts, laws and regulations surrounding repurposed medicines need to adapt as well, in order for patients to fully reap the benefits of this research. \\nRules governing intellectual property (IP), for instance, do not currently offer provisions for IP protection of drug discovery through repositioning and protection for such drugs remains limited. Similarly, insurance companies may not reimburse for drugs prescribed off-label.\\nAndrea Califano, cofounder of DarwinHealth and professor of systems biology at Columbia University, referenced this dilemma in relation to drug repositioning studies involving carfilzomib, used in treating multiple myeloma.\\n\"We predict very consistently carfilzomib for ovarian cancer,\" Califano said. \"The drug costs $120,000 a year, so unless insurance reimburses it, it\\'s not gonna happen.\" \\nÂ\\xa0\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nCHICAGO â€“ Bioinformaticians with the Australian e-Health Research Centre at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research OrganisationÂ\\xa0have developed a computing algorithm to detect foreign DNA in whole-genome sequences by looking for shifts in k-mer signatures. Unlike previous alignment-free methods, this algorithm works without prior knowledge of the genome or the inserted DNA. \\nCalled Inserted Sequence Information Detector, or INSIDER, the method converts sequences of variable lengths into genomic signatures, then analyzes the signatures of genomic segments to identify the origins of sequence clusters. INSIDER does not require a reference genome, nor does it need to know the genetic material that was actually inserted.\\nThe CSIRO team described the method in a paper published last month in the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal. The paper calls INSIDER \"the first tool specifically designed to specifically function with no prior knowledge about the genome, meaning it can be readily used to [analyze] completely novel genomes.\"\\nDenis Bauer, bioinformatics group leaderÂ\\xa0at CSIRO, said that the issue of foreign DNA has popped up not only in genetics researchÂ\\xa0but in biosecurity, which CSIRO has an interest in as well. She noted that foreign DNA could have negative or positive effects on the rest of an organism; the latter might happen in the case of a CRISPR gene edit.\\nBauer said that INSIDER originated from COVID-19 research early year, in which CSIRO was tasked to differentiate strains of SARS-CoV-2. In that work, described in an April 2020 paper in Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, Bauer and colleagues calculated k-mer frequencies from whole-genome sequences of viral isolates, then plotted the distance between strains that might vary from traditional phylogenic-tree distances that only show mutations.\\n\"This one allows us to look at deletions and complex rearrangements as well,\" Bauer said. \"Well, if we can differentiate between strains of viruses, can we then go deeper and differentiate between blocks of foreign DNA?\"\\nIn the Computational and Structural Biology Journal article, the researchers wrote that the ability to identify foreign DNA for health and biosecurity purposes, including gene drives and antimicrobial resistance \"does not exist for poorly characterized host genomes or with limited information about the integrated sequence.\" \\nThey said that the identification of foreign DNA with previous methods was \"time-consuming and complicated, requiring significant manual processing.\"\\nThe researchers decided to take a metagenomic strategy, looking at genomic signatures to identify sequences that came from a different species than the host organism. \"This approach significantly reduces the search space from an entire genome to a more focused selection of potential sequences of interest,\" according to the paper.\\nIndeed, the CSIRO bioinformaticians chose gene drives and antimicrobial resistance as use cases for testing the INSIDER algorithm. They also built a synthetic dataset to simulate the placement of an RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas gene drive into the genomes of wild-type yeast and bacteria.\\n\"Being able to monitor the acquired sequences by distinguishing foreign from host genome is vital for a range of health, ecological, and environmental applications, such as monitoring the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) or monitoringÂ\\xa0genetic changesÂ\\xa0in wild populations,\" the researchers wrote. \"INSIDER is therefore a powerful tool that will streamline the process of identifying integrated DNA of unknown origin in poorly characterized wild species, allowing for enhanced monitoring of emerging biosecurity threats.\"\\nAfter confirming that k-mer signatures can help them determine that sequences came from different organisms, the researchers generated short sequences from yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish, mouse, and human genomes. They were able to determine that their method is accurate with clusters as small as 2 kilobytes.\\n\"INSIDER can streamline the process of identifying integrated DNA, reducing the search space from the entire genome to only targeted sequences, and requires no prior knowledge about the genome or inserted sequence,\" they wrote. \\nThe CSIRO team created three use cases for their study, one looking at gene drives, one examining antimicrobial resistance, and a third made up of synthetic data. The synthetic data was necessary because INSIDER struggled to differentiate between human and mouse cells, according to Bauer.\\nINSIDER builds genetic profiles by counting the frequency of k-mers in each sequence, then compares it to the average of a particular organism. This allows the algorithm to determine whether something in the sequence is abnormal.\\n\"It is the first method that really [allows] us to do that,\" Bauer said. \"I think there is a lot of need for an algorithm like that,\" Bauer said.\\nSteffen Pallarz, bioinformatics officer at the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, called the translation of genetic code to k-mer profiles \"very promising\" as a means of understanding unknown genetic samples.\\n\"Being able to quickly compare and analyze samples, without the need for reference genomes, and therefore without the resource-intensive alignment or assembly steps, is a great advantage for numerous analysis aims,\" Pallarz said via email. \"Also, using profiles to filter a metagenomics dataset can be very efficient.\"\\nPallarz, a former postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics knowledge management at Humboldt University of Berlin, noted that he employed a similar technique in his doctoral dissertation to look for infections in plant transcriptome samples. \\nBauer stopped short of calling INSIDER a major breakthrough or some other superlative, and noted that there is always room for improvement. She added that the CSIRO bioinformatics team is now looking for limitations in the technology, such as by making k-mers larger to test the sensitivity of INSIDER.\\n\"Potentially, we could differentiate between mouse and human or potentially even closer-related species,\" Bauer said. \"We have to find the best practice for application cases because it would differ between application cases,\" she added.\\nThe CSIRO researchers said that future work might look to incorporate common genomic signatures into INSIDER to be more precise at distinguishing between significant and expected signature variation when examining closely related species. They surmised that longer k-mers could help with creating this separation. \\nBauer believes that this method can have applicability far beyond the three use cases in the published research. \"I\\'m still quite surprised at such a simplistic method,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s a simplistic idea, but it is so powerful. We can apply it to any area,\" Bauer explained. \"Antimicrobial resistance and gene drivers are the first things that we were thinking of, but now the sky\\'s the limit, I guess.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK â€”Â\\xa0Adding a polygenic risk score to clinical models of schizophrenia prognosis does not improve their predictive performance, a new study has found.\\nSchizophrenia is a highly polygenic disease and polygenic risk scores â€” which are thought to be a key aspect of personalizing medicine â€” can capture its genetic liability. However, whether polygenic risk scores can improve predictions of diseases or their outcomes in clinical practice is still under investigation.\\nResearchers led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\\'s Alexander Charney examined whether adding a polygenic risk score to clinical schizophrenia assessments could improve their ability to predict a range of outcomes. Charney noted in an email that schizophrenia polygenic risk scores are among the most powerful and explain more of the variance in disease than risk scores for other diseases can.\\nBut as they reported Monday in Nature Medicine, the researchers\\' analysis of more than 8,500 individuals suggested that the addition did not improve the performance of clinical prediction models.\\nThis outcome, Charney said, should not be surprising to people who have been doing research using polygenic risk scores, but could be to others who are familiar with such risk scores but haven\\'t studied them personally. That, he added, is because polygenic risk scores tend to be described as a tool that is expected to have clinical utility. \"There is a disconnect of sorts between the perspectives of people who work closely with PRS and the way PRS has been presented to the greater scientific community,\" he said.\\nFor their analysis, Charney and his colleagues examined electronic medical record data from the BioMe biobank â€” a cohort of more than 30,000 individuals from New York\\'s Mount Sinai Health System â€” to identify 762 individuals who had been billed for schizophrenia- or related psychosis-linked treatment and amassed clinical outcomes data. Of these, the researchers focused on six areas indicative of poor outcomes: inpatient treatment, prescription of multiple antipsychotics or of clozapine, aggressive or self-injurious behavior, and homelessness.\\nAt the same time, the researchers generated a schizophrenia polygenic risk score using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study of the disease. This score could, with statistical significance, explain some of the variance in inpatient treatment and aggressive behavior.\\nBut when the researchers examined how well models could predict these outcomes based on clinical features alone, clinical features plus the polygenic risk score, and polygenic risk score alone, the addition of the polygenic risk score did not improve predictive ability.\\nAdditionally, in 7,779 cases from the multiethnic Genomic Psychiatry Cohort, the addition of a polygenic risk score also did not improve outcome predictions. For this cohort, the outcomes analyzed differed and were based on a validated checklist of symptoms, including suicidality, impairment, whether symptoms responded to anti-psychotic medications, and disease course.\\nFor both cohorts, the researchers noted that the findings held across genetic ancestry groups.\\nThese results suggested that a schizophrenia polygenic risk score does not improve predictions of patient outcomes better than information that is collected clinically. This, the researchers noted, is in line with findings from other studies and underscores the need for polygenic risk scores to not only be predictive but alsoÂ\\xa0provide additional information that cannot easily be gleaned elsewhere.\\nThe researchers noted that their analysis relies on a polygenic risk score built from a genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, rather than an analysis of schizophrenia outcomes and that predictions using scores based on such studies might have performed better. \\nCharney added that he and his colleagues are now examining the relationship between the polygenic risk score and social determinants of health. Or put another way, he said, they are considering \"the age-old question of nature versus nurture.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

By sequencing more than 100 captive koalas of known pedigrees, the researchers found that the virus appears to largely be passed from mother to offspring â€” possibly via infected milk â€” with few instances of transmission between adult koalas. According to the researchers, this finding suggests various strategies to prevent the virus\\'s spread, including breeding programs and antiretroviral treatment of mothers during the breeding season. \"While substantial research is needed to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, this presents a potentially important conservation strategy for koala populations severely affected by disease and currently in rapid decline,\" they add.\\nA team of researchers in Japan has identified groups of metabolites that could be used to diagnose or treat different types of dementia, including Alzheimer\\'s disease. For their new study, they collected blood samples from dementia patients as well as from healthy elderly and healthy young individuals for metabolomic analysis. Through their liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-based analysis, the researchers uncovered 33 metabolites that they classified into five subgroups that differed between individuals with dementia and healthy elderly individuals . In particular, they report that compounds from group A may act as neurotoxins and are increased in those with dementia, while compounds from the other groups, which may be protective or supportive, decline in dementia. \"Our results suggest that detailed molecular diagnosis of dementia is now possible,\" they say.\\nA University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison team explores genetic growthâ€“defense trade-offs among the trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). The group followed the trees for five years to find that high competition led to decreased survival of trees with slow-growing genotypes versus fast-growing genotypes, while low competition led to increased survivorship of all growth genotypes. At the same time, high competition was linked to low survivorship for well-defended genotypes. \"We found that a genetically fixed growthâ€“defense trade-off coupled with high levels of competition led to simultaneous selection for genotypes with both high growth rates and low herbivore defense levels,\" the researchers write, noting that their findings also \"help explain nonintuitive patterns of defense allocation across populations where herbivory is not the principal selective force.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

Q2Â\\xa0revenues were strongly driven by COVID testing, he said, \"but most importantly, we\\'re seeing the return of growth in our core business.\"\\nFor the three months ended June 30, the rare disease diagnostics company, based in Rostock, Germany, reported â‚¬51.9 million ($61.5 million) in revenues compared to â‚¬9.7 million in the year-ago quarter, significantly beating the average Wall Street estimate of $41.4 million.\\nQ2 COVID-19 testing revenues totaled â‚¬42.3 million, up from â‚¬2.1 million a year ago. Meanwhile, revenues from the company\\'s core business, which consists of clinical diagnostics and pharmaceutical contracts, increased 25 percent to â‚¬9.5 million from â‚¬7.6 million. \\nSpecifically, clinical diagnostic revenues grew 81 percent toÂ\\xa0 â‚¬6.7 million from â‚¬3.7 million in Q2 of 2020, while pharmaceutical revenues were down 38 percent to â‚¬2.8 million from â‚¬3.9 million last year.\\nAround 34 percent of its diagnostics revenues came from whole-exome sequencing, while 23 percent came from panel testing, 17 percent from standard genetic testing, 15 percent from whole-genome sequencing, 11 percent from noninvasive prenatal testing, and 0.1 percent from biochemical testing.\\nCFO RenÃ© Just said during the call that diagnostics revenues increased primarily because of higher requests for whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing tests.\\nPharma revenues decreased during the quarter because of the pandemic, but Centogene has already signed pharma contracts in the first half of 2021 that exceed those signed during all of 2020 in value, he said, including seven new pharma services contracts signed in Q2.\\nDuring the quarter, the company processed 679,900 COVID-19 tests. It also had 29,100 diagnostic test requests, up 54 percent from 18,850 in Q2 of 2020, and added approximately 24,000 patients to its bio/databank, which now has more than 650,000 patients.\\nCentogene also started a new collaboration with immunoneurology firm Alector to diagnose patients with frontotemporal dementia, a genetic neurodegenerative disease; extended its partnership with Takeda to diagnose patients with certain genetic disorders; and extended the Rostock International Parkinson\\'s Disease (ROPAD) study, which now aims to recruit and test an additional 2,500 patients with Parkinson\\'s disease.\\nCentogene\\'s R&D expenses in Q2 totaled â‚¬4.1 million, up 32 percent year over year from â‚¬3.1 million, mainly due to increased personnel and IT-related expenses. Its SG&A costs totaled â‚¬12.4 million, up 22 percent year over year from â‚¬10.2 million, related to increased personnel expenses, legal and administrative costs, IT support, and data centers.\\nThe firm\\'s net loss for the quarter was â‚¬8.2 million, or â‚¬.37 per share, compared to a net loss of â‚¬10.4 million, or â‚¬.52 per share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected a net loss of $.23 per share (â‚¬.19 per share).\\nAs of June 30, Centogene had â‚¬34.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.\\nFor all of 2021, the company expects to have total revenues surpassing those of 2020. Its core business is expected to grow in the second half of 2021, while the COVID-19 testing business, which is difficult to predict, will likely slow down, according to Oswald. \"We are fully confident that we will return to solid core growth, not only in diagnostics but also in pharma,\" he said.\\nIn morning trading on the Nasdaq, Centogene shares were up a fraction of a percent at $10.60.\\n\\n'},\n",

Lenders will examine the credit report of a potential borrower when they apply for a car loan or other asset finance, including motorbike finance, using the information to determine a credit score. Poor credit history makes it more likely the application will be rejected.\\nNational Loans explains there are things a borrower can do to improve their credit score, such as paying down any outstanding debts by making more than the minimum monthly repayment, paying bills and other repayments on time and avoiding making multiple applications for credit over a short period of time.\\nSaving up a bigger deposit will also work in a borrower's favour, says National Loans. Applying for a smaller loan makes a borrower less risky, which improves their chances of getting approved. Additionally, it can also reduce monthly repayments and the rate charged on the loan.\\nOther options for those with a poor or limited credit history include having a relative or friend go guarantor on the loan. National Loans advises that the guarantor needs a good credit history and stable income. Borrowers should also only be applying for loans they can afford as lenders will look at their income and outgoings to help make an assessment. National Loans provides a car loan calculator on their website that borrowers can use to run the numbers. The car's running and maintenance costs should be factored into the budget.\\nAs National Loans points out, there are different types of car loans available, including secured or unsecured, fixed-rate or variable. Balloon payment car loans are another option. It's important for borrowers to choose the right type of loan that suits their circumstances.\\nAs an expert broker, National Loans can help borrowers get first-time approval on finance applications, like balloon car loans, even if their credit score isn't perfect.\\nNational Loans is the trusted expert for car loans and asset finance, working with Australia's top lenders to offer low-rate car loans and fast approvals to borrowers.

John had a vision for an insurance program built for the unique needs of the independent hardware retailer. John wanted a program that would help control insurance costsÂ\\xa0while ensuring stores had the proper coverage. The Cotter Insurance Program was born, thus leading to the creation of Member Insurance Ltd. (MIL).\\nMIL is the parent company of AHLI. MIL is a class 3, Bermuda insurance company. MIL is owned by the policyholders whose insurance is placed by AHLI and reinsured by MIL. AHLI supplies insurance to independent hardware stores, lumber dealers, building material dealers, nursery and garden centers and rental centers, specializing in cooperatives and associations throughout the United States. AHLI formed American Lumber Underwriters (ALU) in 2007, a wholesaler primarily servicing the lumber market. In February 2021, Member Insurance rebranded and is now known as American Hardware & Lumber Insurance.\\nThe company\\'s operating philosophy, which emphasizes a focus on its customers, its employees and its member-owners, connects the most with what the brand stands for -- quality, innovation, customer-focus, and a values-rich culture.\\nScott Reynolds, President and Chief Executive Officer of AHLI, said, \"We take great pride in the long-term value we have created for our member-owners over the past five decades by adhering to our core operating philosophy and culture. Despite our growth and evolution, we remain true to the original vision of John Cotter. We continue to offer innovative products while remaining financially strong and customer-focused, with links to our industry and a nod to an exciting future.\"\\nReynolds continued, \"On behalf of our board and management team, I want to extend our thanks and appreciation to our member-owners, customers, partners, and employees around the United States, whose continued confidence and trust have been so essential to our long-term success. We are extremely excited to celebrate 50 years and look forward to a continuing history of innovative ideas, products and services that meet the unique needs of hardware stores, lumber dealers, building material dealers, nursery and garden centers and rental centers, specializing in cooperatives and associations.\"\\nAbout American Hardware & Lumber Insurance\\nFounded in 1972, American Hardware & Lumber Insurance (www.americanhli.com) supplies insurance to independent hardware stores, lumber dealers, building material dealers, nursery and garden centers and rental centers, specializing in cooperatives and associations throughout the United States.\\nMedia Contact\\nMary-Jo Salzburg\\nPhone:Â\\xa0 (847) 277-2601\\nEmail:Â\\xa0 info@americanhli.com\\nSource: American Hardware & Lumber Insurance\\n'},\n",

The state\\'s largest smoke accessories wholesaler, which carries both prominent names and exciting new brands, will now list available quantities alongside its product details to provide the latest up-to-date stock details.\\nWith more than 50 different categories, upwards of 200 distinct brands, and 10,000+ best-selling products which range from glass pipes, vapes, papers, waterpipes, and grinders to hookahs, lighters, incense, and ashtrays, MWI has quite an extensive online catalog of products. With so many products, MWI realized that its long-term, loyal customers were finding it challenging to grab the great product deals they wanted before the items sold out. To address this issue and create a more satisfying client experience, the team has updated the online store and will be providing clients with updated stock quantities on all 10,000+ items as soon as they log in to the site.\\nIndividual quantities of MWI\\'s products are typically updated hourly, giving customers the very best chance to get a hold of the hottest new brands and most sought-after products that have just arrived at the warehouse, including top items from Truweigh Scales, Esco Bars, Rare Disposables, and King Palm.\\nMike Sohani, MWI CEO, says, \"As a leading distributor committed to exceptional levels of customer care, it has always been our intention to ensure that our products are in stock exactly when our business customers need them. However, with so many of our items proving to be highly sought-after bestsellers from the hottest brands, we often find that products sell out before we\\'ve had a chance to update our listings. Now, with the rollout of our exciting new website feature, we hope to be able to provide more accurate, more transparent information to users, which will go a long way towards creating the ultimate website experience.\"\\nMWI hopes that its new stock feature will provide a greater level of support for existing smoke shops and new start-ups that are looking to rapidly grow and expand their store and boost their own customer base. The availability of near real-time updates will empower businesses to plan strategically.\\nWhile MWI stocks thousands of products at any given time, the company is always looking to bring in more fantastic brands that customers truly love. If the new feature shows that a particular brand or product isn\\'t currently available, the MWI team is happy to attempt to source the item.\\nTo find out more about MWI, visit https://www.gomwi.com/ or our informational blog.\\nSource: Mike\\'s World Wide Inc.\\n'},\n",

The \"Asia\\'s Most Influential Brands of 2021\" list was released at the summit, which represents the 16th time that World Brand Lab has evaluated the influence of Asian brands. A total of 500 brands from 19 countries and regions were selected. ESG, which stands for environmental, social, and corporate governance, was included in the evaluation system for the first time. Toyota, State Grid, and ICBC are listed as the top three influencers. Haier, Tencent, Samsung, Sony, Honda, China Life and Huawei are also listed in the top ten. China, Japan, and South Korea are the three countries with the most selected brands. Elie Ofek, professor at Harvard Business School, and Ziv Carmon, professor at INSEAD, attended the summit and delivered a keynote speech.\\nThe selection criterion is the brand\\'s Asian influence, which refers to the brand\\'s ability to explore the market, occupy the market, and earn profits. The basic indicators used by World Brand Lab to evaluate the influence of Asian brands include market share, brand loyalty, and global leadership. ESG rating scores from the leading financial analysis firm Superfinance were referenced for the first time when evaluating Global Leadership. The 2021 list includes brands selected from 19 countries and regions. China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) has 212 brands, ranking first among all countries, and mainland China has 166 brands. Japan has 134 brands selected, ranking second, and South Korea is third with 50 brands.\\nConsumer loyalty in the Asian market varies in different countries. Japanese consumers still have the highest national brand loyalty, with 80%. South Korea ranks second with a 70% loyalty score, and brand loyalty in China increased to 61%, ranking third overall. With the advent of the post-pandemic era, more people are recognizing the relationship between food choices and natural ecology. Consumer demand is soaring for healthy, green food with a low-carbon footprint, which will significantly influence future consumption preferences in the Asian food and beverage industry. On \"Asia\\'s 500 Most Influential Brands of 2021\" list, Moutai, Wuliangye, and Tsingtao Brewery rank among the top three in the food and beverage industry, and these brands already have a strong global influence. This year has 38 new brands on the list, four of which are in the food and beverage industry.\\nThe theme of this year\\'s \"Asia Brand Summit\" is \"How Asian Brands Cultivate Global Leadership.\" Ziv Carmon, professor at INSEAD, believes that to improve the global influence of Asian brands from the perspective of consumer psychology, it is crucial to have deep customer insight, which allows brands to better understand what consumers think and build a more effective branding campaign. Harvard Business School marketing professor Elie OfekÂ\\xa0believes that a brand creates a bond between a company\\'s products and consumers, thus influencing the consumers\\' perception of and connection to the company and the resonance of the brand. Brands play a pivotal role in the overall customer journey, and such a role is crucial for Asian brands to go global. To increase global influence, Asian brands need to dig deeper into the market and identify potential gaps to position the brands properly.\\nHaisen Ding, founder of World Executive Group and CEO of the World Brand Lab, believes that although Asian brands such as Toyota, Samsung, and Sony have enjoyed long-term global influence, there is still room for improvement in Asian brand leadership compared to American super brands. Companies such as Goldman Sachs, Disney, and Boeing not only provide excellent goods and services, they export leaders. Their executives have the ability to independently run other companies. Leadership is a form of reputation created by the company, which also can meet the expectations of consumers and investors. Companies with a reputation for leadership brands make people believe that each of their employees and managers will indeed fulfill the company\\'s promises.\\nWorld Brand Lab, wholly owned by the leading strategic consulting and business communication company World Executive Group, is an international brand value research institution, founded on the initiative of and first chaired by Professor Robert Mundell, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics. The current chair is Professor Steve Woolgar from the University of Oxford.\\nPress Contact\\nWorld Brand Lab\\n212-208-1429\\ninfo@worldbrandlab.com\\nhttp://www.worldbrandlab.com\\nSource: World Brand Lab\\n'},\n",

The Challenge will call on entrepreneurs, innovators, start-ups, and community-based organizations to submit ideas for transformational innovation to advance health equity in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York and Philadelphia. Johnson & Johnson will start accepting applications on Sept. 28, 2021.\\nThe future is now with Shopify. Through initiatives such as Build Black and its support of the 1MBB movement, Shopify has continued to reshape the ways in which minorities are supported and businesses, especially Black-owned businesses, are given a platform to be seen.

Focused on Black business, yet inclusive to all, the Build Black with Shopify Roundtable will not only showcase entrepreneurs who have built their businesses thanks to Shopify, but inspire viewers and future entrepreneurs to build their own brands.Â\\xa0\\nKlaviyo is committed to helping Black-owned businesses own their data, their customer relationships and the experiences they deliver.

For Black Entrepreneurs Day, Alvin Bowles, Facebook\\'s Vice President of Business EcosystemÂ\\xa0Partnerships, will join Daymond John on stage to discuss Facebook\\'s support of Black-owned small businesses, creators and nonprofits in the U.S. Facebook is continuing to iterate on ways to support businesses that have been the most adversely impacted by the pandemic, including the recent launch of the Facebook Invoice Fast Track program which gives minority-owned small businesses the ability to access the liquidity that they need right now through a $100 million program.\\nYappa, the audio and visual commenting tool established by Black founders Jennifer Dyer and Kiaran Sim, will be returning to Black Entrepreneurs Day this year for the Live Q+A with Daymond John.

              "  'D': '\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tNEW YORK,\\n\\t\\t\\tSeptember 23, 2021\\t\\t\\t(Newswire.com) -\\n\\t\\niQuanti: Equity financing can be a viable funding option for small business owners. To understand small business equity financing, an important type of commercial real estate lending for small businesses, let\\'s answer some of the biggest questions surrounding it.\\nHow Does Small Business Equity Financing Work?\\nSmall business equity financing involves raising money from investors. You can sell \"shares\" of your business to family members, friends, and others. At this point, anyone who owns a share is a partial owner of your company.\\nHow Much Equity Financing Can You Receive?\\nYou can earn as much small business equity financing as you\\'d like. As a small business owner, you can meet with investors to promote your company. From here, you can sell shares to fund your business.\\nWhat Types of Small Business Equity Financing Are Available?\\nHere are five of the most popular equity funding options for small businesses.\\n1. Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)\\nThe Small Business Administration offers an SBIC program that provides venture capital funds to small business owners. These funds come from venture capital firms that pool investors\\' money to finance startup (and potentially high-risk) companies.\\n2. Angel Investment\\nAn angel investor offers small business equity financing with the expectation of a high return on investment. Angel investors are typically wealthy individuals or groups that use their personal funds for equity financing. In addition, they often provide knowledge and insights to help a small business realize its full potential.\\n3. Venture Capital\\nVenture capitalists operate in a similar fashion to angel investors. The difference is that venture capitalists do not use their personal funds for equity financing. Instead, a venture capital firm can pool together money from several investors who want to invest in your company. In some instances, venture capitalists may invest in your company and request a seat on your business\\' board of directors, too.\\n4. Mezzanine Funding\\nMezzanine financing can provide an excellent funding option for mid-sized companies. For instance, a lender can provide your business with mezzanine funding with certain conditions, such as requiring you to achieve various financial performance goals.\\nAre Small Business Equity Financing Alternatives Available?\\nDebt financing offers an alternative to equity funding. With debt financing, a creditor can lend you money for your small business. You will be required to repay the creditor with interest in the future.\\nIs Small Business Equity Financing Right for You?\\nEquity financing can provide a great funding option for small business owners. However, small business equity financing can be risky. Even if you obtain equity funding, it does not guarantee your business will succeed.\\nDebt financing options are readily available as well. You can use debt financing to receive funding for your small business. At the same time, debt financing does not require you to sell shares of your company. Thus, it ensures you can maintain sole business ownership.\\nOn the other hand, debt financing requires you to work with a creditor. And you are responsible for repaying a creditor\\'s loan, regardless of your company\\'s performance.\\nIf you\\'re uncertain about whether this financing is right for you, evaluate all of the options at your disposal. Furthermore, meet with a financial consultantÂ\\xa0who can help you assess these options in detail. ThenÂ\\xa0you can identify the best financing option for your small business.\\nSource: iQuanti, Inc.\\n'},\n",

              "  'C': 'In the Wake of South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., Manufacturers Face Increased Pressure to Meet Growing Compliance Requirements with Limited Resources All While Avoiding Substantial Audit Assessments',\n",
              "  'D': '\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tARLINGTON, Va.,\\n\\t\\t\\tSeptember 23, 2021\\t\\t\\t(Newswire.com) -\\n\\t\\nEvery state has established economic nexus standards in the aftermath of the landmark 2018 Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. placing increased sales tax compliance responsibilities, even in the absence of a physical presence. Today, the Manufacturers Alliance Foundation and Sovos released \"The Changing Landscape for Sales and Use Tax Strategies,\" a new report that shows the extent to which tax compliance challenges are driving increasingly sophisticated process changes for manufacturers.\\nThe decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. opened the door to increased sales and use tax collection obligations across the country. With the rapid rise of online sales, and the fact that manufacturers are increasingly investing in e-commerce as a path to growth, companies now see a significantly greater need to effectively and efficiently meet a nationwide compliance obligation.\\n\"With over 12,000 sales tax jurisdictions with their own rates and each state having different rules, the 2018 case really increased the need for more effective, streamlined compliance for tax departments,\" Manufacturers Alliance spokesperson Marie Lee observed.\\nThe new joint research by Sovos and the Manufacturers Alliance Foundation assessed the implications of this new pressure on manufacturers. The study, which included a survey of more than 70 tax leaders in manufacturing, led to five findings that reflect key considerations for leaders making sales and use tax-related decisions:\\n\\n\\nImproving efficiency in sales and use tax compliance and integrating sales tax technology are key priorities for manufacturers - These two areas were the top selections by far among respondents when asked what their key sales and use tax priorities were for the next year. The notion that thoughtful and targeted expansion of tax technology solutions can meaningfully move the needle on efficiency seems well-established within the industry.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0\\n\\nBusiness strategy and technology change add considerable complexity to sales and use tax compliance - Overall, 44% of executives reported that changes in business strategy (for example, M&A) added significant complexity to the tax compliance process. Technology change (for example, migrating to a different ERP system) followed at 35%.\\n\\nStreamlining sales and use tax processes is more important than ever - Two-thirds (67%) of executives noted that reducing manual effort in the sales and use tax compliance process was their top priority for next year. Other streamlining priorities, such as integrating tax information from disparate sources were also key priorities.\\n\\nSales and use tax audits are increasing - In the new environment, manufacturing executives are forecasting an increase in the frequency of sales and use tax audits, with 78% anticipating more audits in the next 12 to 36 months.\\n\\nInvesting in additional technologies and analytics is a top priority in expanding sales and use tax compliance - A majority of executives stated that investing in additional sales and use tax technology was their most important strategy over the year.\\n\\n\"Sales tax audits, as we know them, are destined to become a relic of the past. It\\'s only a matter of time before governments embrace technology enabling an entirely digital audit experience. When human capacity no longer constrains how expansively and extensively states can audit, sellers should be ready for a dramatic uptick in audit frequency,\" says Charles Maniace, VP of Regulatory Analysis & Design at Sovos.\\nAbout Manufacturers AllianceÂ\\xa0FoundationÂ\\xa0\\nManufacturers AllianceÂ\\xa0Foundation is the 501(c)(3) partner of Manufacturers Alliance.

              "  'D': \"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tDUBAI, Arab Emirates,\\n\\t\\t\\tSeptember 23, 2021\\t\\t\\t(Newswire.com) -\\n\\t\\nThere has never been a more important time for people to focus on their health and well-being, and thereforeÂ\\xa0never a better time to understand the impact of sleep on our lives. Good sleep is essential in helping the body regenerate, repair, and recover, which in turn strengthens the immune system to keep us healthy. One of the most effective ways to ensure a proper night's sleep is to invest in the best mattress possible. Magniflex has been a global leader in the mattress industry for 60 years and is the premier mattress store in Dubai, with a goal of offering a rest that is supremely comfortable, improves the quality of life, and is in harmony with the environment.\\nDuring the past year when the world has sometimes been paralyzed by Covid-19, Magniflex has never wavered from our goals and used 2020 as an opportunity to innovate further with the introduction of the MagniProtect mattress. The MagniProtect range was the first sleep collection in the world with antiviral effectiveness specifically tested against COVID-19 and was launched with great success in Dubai in August 2020. Featuring the exclusive MagniProtect fabric, the MagniProtect mattress includes a combination of vesicle and silver technology that focuses on inhibiting the growth and persistence of bacteria and viruses in a few minutes. With the MagniProtect mattress, you can truly rest in a place where you feel safe.Â\\xa0\\nIt is not the first time Magniflex has introduced a new and unique mattress,Â\\xa0and it follows the huge success of the MagniStretch mattress in 2018. Designed in association with the University of Zaragoza in Spain, MagniStretch has the ability to gently stretch the spine during sleep and is the only orthopedic mattress in Dubai endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association. The patented structure of the MagniStretch mattress reduces muscular contraction and decompression of the spine while preventing compacted vertebrae. Your body will feel rejuvenated thanks to an increased blood flow that revitalizes your discs and the improved postural habit helps to reduce neck and back pain.Â\\xa0\\nMagniProtect and MagniStretch are just twoÂ\\xa0of the mattress models that have earned Magniflex reviews as the best mattress in Dubai, with customers feeling the benefit of a focus on spring-free mattresses across the Magniflex range. Many other mattresses contain springs, which can create upward pressure on the body causing discomfort and pain throughout the night. Rather than having to adapt to springs, Magniflex mattresses are designed to adapt to your body and keep it correctly positioned while you sleep. Springs can also lose their strength with use, which causes spring mattresses to lose their shape and reduce support over time, whereas Magniflex mattresses are made with high-quality foams that are designed to keep their shape for many years.\\nSource: Magniflex\\n\"},\n",

Chile has one of the most sustainable wine industries in the world, with nearly all of the wines it produces falling under some category of environmental or social responsibility. Producers of 80% of the total Chilean wines on the shelves honor the Wines of Chile Sustainability Code. More than 60% of Chilean bottled wine exports, have joined the initiative to measure the carbon footprint aligned with the objectives of the Science-Based Targets Organization.Â\\xa0\\nOne of Wines of Chile 2021\\'s highlights is Vitata, the initiative of Valle Itata winemakers to export small yet fantastic productions of Cinsault, Moscatel, PaÃ\\xads and many other \\'underground\\' wine varities.Â\\xa0\"Itata is a wine region that deserves more attention at the moment, and this area is shining because it has the fundamental elements for wine. I tell my clients to try the wines of the Itata Valley. These are vineyards that are more than 200 years old and that if they were in Europe, many people would be paying a lot of money for these bottles. These Chilean wines have received little attention. That is why it is the responsibility of these producers to tell their story. The uniqueness of this region will shine brightly on the planet of wine\", Paul Grieco, Ph.D. in Terroir.\\nFrom the Atacama Desert,Â\\xa0through the Central ValleyÂ\\xa0and up to the Austral region, Chile\\'s variety of landscapes and geographical features make it an ideal environment for food production. As a result, the country is one of the main exportersÂ\\xa0in the world for fresh and dry fruits, salmon and seafoods, superfoods such as algae, maqui berries and more. The Magellan Region is internationally known for its extraordinary sheep and lamb meat production and can be currently found in stores such as Whole Foods USA.\\nAs Chilean startups grow internationally, many have attracted private capital and generated employment. This is reflected in investments including those made by Jeff Bezos in NotCo, Uber in Cornershop, and Fintual\\'s participation in the renowned accelerator YCombinator. These achievements are largely due to ChileÂ´s mature technology ecosystem of highly innovative solutions that have been rapidly positioned with key players at the international level.

Most projects take several months to complete; only 2% said the average turnaround time for an automation project is less than one month.\\n\"Many enterprises today are looking to enter the next phases of their automation journey, but lack the technical resources to scale those efforts,\" said Sagi Eliyahu, CEO and Co-Founder at Tonkean. \"This survey reveals the need for solutions that let IT empower business teams to build, compose and maintain their own automation projects without technical resources.\"\\nTonkean has seen demand for its no-code process orchestration platform accelerate in recent months, as more enterprise teams seek to advance their automation efforts to improve business processes. Tonkean partnered with Pulse on this survey to better understand the scale of these challenges and priorities among an established community of IT leaders.\\n\"The Pulse community is a private community of verified business and technology leaders, producing honest insights in a trusted, vendor-free platform,\" said Pulse CEO and co-founder Mayank Mehta. \"Our community engages around hot topics in IT and survey results like these indicate the common priorities and challenges they share.\"Â\\xa0Â\\xa0\\nOther key findings included:Â\\xa0\\n\\nA plurality of IT leaders (42%) who say their top priority around automation is using it to handle dynamic or human-centric processes, instead of just automating disparate tasks.\\nRespondents were asked to rate the maturity level of their process automation on a 1-5 scale. Most respondents (60%) from mid-sized organizations rated themselves at level 3 \"Systematic\", while enterprises were split between levels 2 \"Opportunistic\" and 3, indicating that enterprise adoption is slightly less mature to date.\\nThe top reasons that custom code is required on automation projects are to create custom integrations to systems (45%), or to extend the functionality of automation with custom logic or actions (29%).Â\\xa0Â\\xa0\\nWhile 56% of leaders said they could support fewer than 10 automation projects annually company-wide, the situation is even more bleak when breaking it down to individual teams, with 74% reporting that their specific team could support fewer than 10 automation projects per year.\\nOnly 7% of respondents said their business teams are enabled to build most or all of their automated workflows today.\\n\\nFor the full results of the survey, visit the \"Business Process Automation Challenges & Priorities\" report page, or learn more at https://tonkean.com/.\\nAbout Tonkean\\nTonkean is the OS for Business Operations, transforming operations teams from facilitators into makers with an enterprise-grade, no-code process orchestration platform.

This edition focuses on the motivations, behaviors, and dispositions of female Americans to cryptocurrencies and investing more broadly.\\nAccording to the survey results, 94% of women have heard of cryptocurrency, but only 9% feel they know a fair amount about the asset class - illustrating a sizable gender gap in terms of industry participants. BlockFi\\'s research shows that the gender gap in cryptocurrency exceeds similar gaps in traditional investments such as equities, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds or real estate.Â\\xa0\\nOnly 29% of women surveyed say they are likely to purchase cryptocurrencies in the next year, despite 50% believing Bitcoin prices will go up in the next 5 years. Similarly, BlockFi\\'s survey found that there is a major hesitancy among women to take investment risks; less than one in four women are willing to take on more than a small amount of risk when investing.\\nIn terms of evaluating various investment options, the survey showed that half of women (50%) rely on conversations with their family and friends to inform their financial decisions, which was more popular than engaging a professional advisor for financial counsel (39%). More than half (57%) of women reported waiting to adopt new technology until most others have. The survey also found that only 23% of women knew how to purchase cryptocurrency if they wanted to do so, and nearly 40% of women find cryptocurrency to be confusing.\\nFlori Marquez, SVP of Operations and Founder of BlockFi said, \"I have witnessed firsthand a hesitation around women discussing their financial health. I\\'m making it my personal mission to change the figures we\\'re sharing today.\"\\nMs. Marquez added, \"In order for more women to be empowered with knowledge on what crypto is and how it works, BlockFi is working diligently to provide crypto-curious women with an in-depth look on the inner workings of cryptocurrencies - from blockchain technology, the history and purpose of altcoins, to the benefits of alternative investing.\"\\nBlockFi\\'s survey revealed that cryptocurrency curiosity amongst women outweighed the percentage of women who feel that it is too risky to invest in. 46% of women respondents indicated they are interested to learn more about cryptocurrency investing and 23% of respondents disagreed that it\\'s \"too late\" to profit in cryptocurrency investing.\\nMethodology\\nThe survey, the first in a quarterly series evaluating womens\\' investment patterns, was conducted by a third-party survey panel between August 6th to August 12th, 2021. 1,023 female Americans between the ages of 18 and 65 were surveyed.\\nAbout BlockFi\\nBlockFi is a new breed of financial services company.

The Zero Hunger Private Sector Pledge is a game-changing solution emerging from the UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) Action Tracks. It recognizes that governments cannot eradicate hunger alone and need more private sector involvement. To date, pledges have been made in 34 priority countries.Â\\xa0The pledge is being supported by a network of partners, including the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), Grow Africa, Grow Asia, the World Benchmarking Alliance, the World Food Programme, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Cornell University.\\nGlobal hunger is rising unabated, with up to 811 million hungry people in the world in 2020, suffering because they did not have access to the most basic need and fundamental right of food. But there is a roadmap to end world hunger. Additional investment in 10 high-impact areas can put hunger in the history books.\\n\"Today, one in ten people go to bed hungry and millions are right on the brink of starvation. This is happening in a world that has enough food to feed everyone, everywhere. It\\'s time to end this suffering. But to succeed, WFP and the entire community need the creative drive, energy, and commitment of the private sector. Through the Zero Hunger Pledge initiative, businesses around the world can join us and truly make a differenceâ€”giving food, hope, and a better future to those who need them most.\"~ David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP) \\nAlthough this financial investment must mostly come from governments, public spending will not be sufficient. That is why the UNFSS came up with a game-changing solution to mobilize more private sector investment as a catalytic contributor to achieving zero hunger. Companies make a financial commitment in at least one of the 10 high-impact intervention areas identified in the Ceres2030 findings and in at least one of the priority countries or regions.\\n\"What we are seeing with the Pledge is the private sector stepping up to be a bigger part of the solution. This is a game-changing approach to solving one of the most pressing yet oldest challenges humanity faces.\"Â\\xa0\\n~ Lawrence Haddad, Executive Director, GAIN\\nWith a level of commitment so far amounting to USD 345 million, the implementing organizations are confident more companies will join in the fight against zero hunger.

The round was led by Greycroft and Alpha Edison with participation from Crosslink Capital, Acadian Ventures, Fika Ventures and Act One Ventures.\\nClovers, through its flagship product, will use conversational intelligence to revolutionize interviewing for the modern world, making interviews more effective and more inclusive for organizations and candidates alike. Interviewing is the most critical step of the recruiting process, but it has typically been under-resourced. Clovers will enhance each step of the interviewing process â€” from the first interview to the final decision. Clovers will offer unbiased, real-time questions for interviewers during the interview, post-interview candidate insights, and postmortem interviewer coaching. Clovers will connect to existing workflows and easily integrate with an organization\\'s applicant tracking system, calendars and current video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Webex.\\nThe company was co-founded in December 2020 by HR tech pioneers Adam Miller, founder and former CEO of Cornerstone OnDemand, and Jason Nazar, co-founder and CEO of Comparably, along with Doug Leonard and Cihan Ucar. Clovers is jointly headquartered in Los Angeles and Nashville.\\n\"The modern workplace and its hiring processes are transforming, driven by technology advancements, the impact of COVID-19 and employee desire for a hybrid remote-office model.Â\\xa0This is causing companies to rethink recruiting, looking for inclusive, equitable and insightful interviews,\" said Doug Leonard, CEO of Clovers. \"Clovers is building an interview intelligence platform to address the massive shift made to hiring over the last 18 months. It is our strong belief that technology should not replace human decision making, only enhance our ability to fairly and accurately assess candidates.\"Â\\xa0Â\\xa0\\n\"The Clovers team brings a vision for the future of human capital management backed by a differentiated product and a track record of building market-defining HR technology. Conversational and artificial intelligence create a tremendous opportunity to enable fair and equitable interviewing across nearly every industry. In a rapidly changing workplace, where employers increasingly benefit from reaching into new and diverse talent pools, Clovers is building a category-defining company,\" said Nate Redmond, Managing Partner at Alpha Edison.\\nThe need for HR departments and recruiters to deliver fair and consistent interviews while uncovering bias is especially timely given the heightened demand for talent and how quickly staffing and HR itself is changing.Â\\xa0In fact, 86 percent of job interviews in 2020 were conducted digitally, a 10-fold increase over 2019. That, combined with the fact that a bad hire can cost an employer up to 30 percent of that employee\\'s first-year earnings and experts estimating 95 percent of workers are thinking about switching jobs, underscores the need for an interview intelligence platform.\\n\"Clovers has the right team, the right technology, and the right vision to address the enormous need for more effective and equitable interviewing,\" said Adam Miller, co-chair of Clovers.\\nThe company said funding will be used toward product development, talent acquisition and marketing.\\nABOUT CLOVERS\\nClovers (www.clovers.ai) is the intelligent interview platform that uses human and conversational intelligence to accelerate hiring, uncover bias, and put the right people in the right role â€” every time.Â\\xa0Founded and built by HR tech veterans from Cornerstone and Comparably, and led by an executive team with deep HR tech, SaaS and product experience, Clovers is focused on making interviewing better for both organizations and candidates.\\nThe company is jointly headquartered in Los Angeles and Nashville.Â\\xa0\\nCONTACT\\nDavid Eckstein\\n415-385-9676\\ndavideckstein@gmail.com\\nSource: Clovers\\n'},\n",

The achievement becomes a major aspect of the young author's success. His book unravels great mysteries for his audience and remains a dominant aspect of his writing.\\nThe first book published by the young author remains a testament to his ability at fictional writing. The book opens up to a story centered on the genre of mystery and portrays the keen focus of the author to arouse a deeper interest by the audience. The writing expression of the book anchors a very subtle aspect of mystery, one that is greatly lauded by readers.\\nAdditionally, writing mystery of this magnitude appears to be quite a difficult task in the realm of literature. As it appears in the book, a mainstream same approach was not adopted by the writer on creating characters. The world in which the story takes place, the narrative voice that is used, and in addition, the obligation to square, in an almost mathematical way, all the threads that have been laid throughout the novel.\\nThe book's ending leaves all readers on a cliffhanger and remains the most special part of the book. The author did not start writing without knowing its ending. There are specific points to reach and lurch through the story, apart from the fact that, of course, it is practically impossible for each piece of the puzzle to fit when the main protagonist appears on the scene.\\nSometimes the beginning is not the best place to start, especially if it is a story or a saga. If you do not know the end, the story can take terrible and meaningless directions by not having a clear path towards which to advance.\\nAs we learn from the first book, the best way to prevent your mystery story from becoming nonsensical and utter absurd is by knowing the ending in advance. It will give you the advantage of having a specific rhythm and fluency and placing the tracks correctly and logically.\\nClues are also great pillar of mystery novels and have been well crafted so that the story can flow and at the same time generate suspicion in the reader. False clues are also an interesting and fun resource, and carefully, the author did not overuse them to prevent readers from getting tired and bored.\\nMedia Contact:Bianca Leon Rodrigues+1 (469) 815-7866biancalrodr@gmail.com\\nSource: Yohann Kamto, author\\n\"},\n",

First announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom in November 2020, the California Rebuilding Fund is a public-private partnership that blends capital from private, philanthropic and public sector organizations to support new lending administered by Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs).\\nGoal: Ensure Funding Available for Years to ComeBorn out of recommendations from the Governor\\'s Task Force on Business and Jobs Recovery, the California Rebuilding Fund received an anchor commitment from the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (IBank); and, although launched in response to the pandemic, the program is addressing credit gaps that have existed for decades, and is continuing to raise public and private investment to ensure funding is available to small businesses for years to come.\\n\"It goes without saying that too many of California\\'s smallest businesses are still reeling from the pandemic,\" said Scott Wu, executive director of IBank. \"Our vision is that this additional funding will not only help those business owners, their employees, and their families to survive, but by growing this fund through continued support from partners around the state, that we will go a step further and ensure they thrive.\"\\nProgram\\'s Early Success Helping Those Historically UnderservedTo date, the Rebuilding Fund has provided loans to more than 700 small businesses with an average loan size of around $63,000. More than 90% of the loans have gone to small businesses that are historically \"un-banked,\" meaning they lack access to credit from traditional financial institutions. These include businesses in low-income communities and those with under $1 million in annual revenue. The additional $56.5 million will bring the total amount raised by the California Rebuilding Fund to more than $100 million, helping California\\'s smallest businesses â€” especially those in economically disadvantaged and historically un-banked or \"under-banked\" areas of the state â€” continue to weather this economic storm and emerge with stronger prospects for growth.\\nStrong and Growing Base of Funders and Supporters Catalyze FundThe California Rebuilding Fund is supported by public, private, and philanthropic investors interested in supporting the equitable growth of small businesses across the state, including IBank, Santa Clara County, San Francisco County, Wells Fargo, First Republic Bank, Bank of America, the Grove Foundation, The Kapor Center, the Panta Rhea Foundation and generous individual donors. The Fund\\'s newest supporters include The Doctors Company, Sonen Capital, Visa Foundation, and others.\\n\"We are excited to collaborate with the California Rebuilding Fund to enable equitable access to capital for historically underserved small and micro businesses as they recover and rebuild,\" said Graham Macmillan, President of Visa Foundation. \"We believe the Fund\\'s approach of providing patient and affordable financing to small business lenders that understand the local market challenges will help small businesses\\' long term growth and resilience.\"\\nSmall Businesses That Received Other Pandemic Relief Are Eligible The Rebuilding Fund\\'s participating community lenders offer a standardized loan with low-cost, transparent and flexible terms for small businesses with loan sizes of up to $100,000. Businesses that have received funding from the state\\'s pandemic grant program or another relief fund are still eligible to receive a low-interest loan from the Rebuilding Fund.\\n\"By the end of 2020, I was all out of options,\" said Alicia Villanueva owner of Alicia\\'s Tamales Los Mayas, a catering and food processing facility in Hayward, California. \"It was then when I learned about the California Rebuilding Fund. I applied through a participating lender, Pacific Community Ventures, and was one of the first small businesses in the state to receive a loan. The loan came at a crucial time for us, and we used the funds for payroll, invested a portion back into the business, and reached new clients.\"\\nEasy to Apply â€” Free Advice and SupportAll interested small business owners should submit a pre-application at www.CALoanFund.org, which will collect standard information about their business and match them with a community lender. If matched, the lender will help the business owners with the application and provide free advice and support through a network of organizations organized by CAMEO (California\\'s statewide micro-business network), Small Business Majority, California\\'s Small Business Development Centers, and Women\\'s Business Centers.\\n\"The California Rebuilding Loan has been an essential product for California-based small businesses in their road to recovery as we move through the effects of the pandemic,\" said Susan Lamping, Vice President at CDC Small Business Finance, one of the 12 participating community lenders. \"It offers our business community access to much needed capital as they rebuild and regain traction, and it allows lenders to increase our lending to support our entrepreneurial community as they get back on their feet.\"\\n\"Under Governor Newsom\\'s strong leadership, the California Rebuilding Fund was created and is one of many tools available to support small businesses as they work to adapt to their new operating reality,\" said Dee Dee Myers, Director of the Governor\\'s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). \"Small businesses and innovative start-ups now have access to free resources and technical assistance to start, manage, grow, and thrive through the new California Office of the Small Business Advocate website.\" Small businesses can learn about other help available to small businesses in the California Small Business Fact Sheet.\\nThe fund is being managed by Kiva Capital Management and arranged by Calvert Impact Capital.

              "  'D': \"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tMELBOURNE, Australia,\\n\\t\\t\\tSeptember 20, 2021\\t\\t\\t(Newswire.com) -\\n\\t\\nAccording to leading finance brokerÂ\\xa0National Loans, boat loans are very similar to car loans, with a typically quick application and approval process that is largely based on a customer's credit score and ability to repay.\\nThere are two main categories of boat finance: secured and unsecured. National Loans offers boat loans in the form of specialist marine finance that uses the boat as security for the loan, or unsecured personal loans that don't use the boat as security.\\nDepending on a person's budget and lifestyle, one loan type may be more suitable than the other. The loans and rates available to an individual will depend on their financial history and the financial institution offering the loan.\\nNational Loans explains that secured boat finance is seen as less risky than an unsecured personal loan because the lender has an asset they can sell should the loan be defaulted on. There is, however, a catch for buyers looking to purchase a used boat. According to National Loans, a secured boat loan can be difficult to obtain if the lender deems the boat to be too old, as it would be more difficult to resell.\\nAn unsecured boat loan doesn't require collateral, but usually has higher interest rates and more restrictions than a secured loan. Additionally, the application process is often more rigorous. National Loans says it is often better for people to finance a boat with a secured boat loan rather than an unsecured boat loan, as secured boat loans typically have more competitive interest rates and flexible repayment terms.\\nNational Loans makes buying a boat simple. With access to a large panel of lenders, the finance experts at National Loans are able to secure the best rate and terms to suit a buyer's needs. National Loans' network includes both bank and non-bank lenders. Working for the client, not the lender, National Loans goes the extra mile to find a financing option that is tailored to an individual's circumstances.\\nNational Loans also provides help accessing caravan loans and other forms of caravan finance.

Premier removalist Jake Removals and Storage explains the phenomenon.\\nTypically, inner-city residents tend to be young, university-educated individuals and couples with no children, explains Jake Removals and Storage. The fast-paced lifestyle offered by inner-city suburbs has long attracted that particular demographic. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has shaken things up.\\nFor nearly two years, Melbourne has been in and out of lockdowns, facing stretches of up to four months of tight restrictions. The vibrancy of the city lifestyle has dimmed for many, and residents have begun to feel cramped in their one- or two-bedroom spaces. This has left many city dwellers craving more space and outdoor areas to call their own. It has also given city residents the freedom to work remotelyÂ\\xa0rather than having to commute to a city-based office every day.\\nAs the top movers Melbourne-wide, Jake Removals and Storage reports that many inner-city residents are looking for not only more room, but also a complete change in pace and lifestyle. Outer suburbs offer a slower, more relaxed way of life - a far cry from the hustle and bustle of the city. Former inner-city residents describe feeling more connected to nature after making the move to an outer suburb.\\nMelburnians have called on removalists Melbourne-wide for help relocating to areas such as the Yarra Ranges and Mount Dandenong. Real estate experts have reported that buyer interest in properties in outer suburbs has skyrocketed since March 2020. Experts have also revealed that eastern suburbs in outer Melbourne have experienced a 5.8% rise in housing prices from June 2020 to June 2021, raising house prices to an average of $910,000 in the outer east.\\nOuter suburbs may well feel like outer space compared to the inner city, but after six arduous lockdowns, that is exactly the substantial lifestyle change that many city dwellers are in search of.\\nFor the best cheap removalists Melbourne-wide, call on the experts, Jake Removals and Storage.\\nAddress\\n368 Ferntree Gully Road,Â\\xa0Notting Hill VIC 3168\\nContact\\n1300 766 658\\n0433 955 908\\nEmail: info@jakemove.com.au\\nSource: Jake Removals\\n\"},\n",

The mouse\\'s versatility and freedom to customize are among the few reasons why early adopters support its campaign. On top of being offered at 34% off retail price, Nextick is here to revolutionize the way people see mouses.\\nNextick is designed like a joystick, providing a comfortable grip for its users and the ability to manipulate a mouse in 3D mid-air space rather than a 2D flat surface. It shines brightest when playing games due to its maco shortcut keys, which allow users to designate specific commands to each key. It also has a vibration control through Bluetooth, which users can turn on so the entire joystick vibrates when certain commands are made, such as shooting.\\nHowever, Nextick also works like a normal mouse. Functions like moving the cursor, clicking, double-clicking, and scrolling are all possible. This provides further versatility than other 3D mouses currently on the market. Nextick can be used conveniently in regular day-to-day settings - whether that\\'s for saving passwords on the shortcut keys or for browsing through Netflix remotely.\\n\"We poured our heart and souls into creating Nextick,\" says Byung Chan Lee, CEO of Aidus. \"It\\'s truly a one-of-a-kind mouse that not only solves the problems of using regular 2D mouses for FPS or shooting games, but also we provide free access to Nextick\\'s SDK so that backers can further unlock Nextick\\'s potential to do even greater things.\"Â\\xa0\\nFor a limited 30-days starting Sept. 13, 2021, Nextick will be available for pre-order at a 34% discount on retail price.

One of the most important functions of SEO is increasing visibility, making it easier for potential customers to find a business. The higher a website ranks on a search engine result page (SERP), the more likely potential customers are to see it and click through to the site.\\nResearch suggests that a quarter of web users don't click past the first SERP. Zib Digital says this makes ranking on the first page even more important. A strong SEO strategy allows brands to position their web pages higher on the SERPs for relevant keywords so they can bring potential customers into their sales funnel.\\nMany elements go into establishing authority on search engines. Zib Digital says in addition to a user-friendly website that is easily discoverable, authority is accrued over time as a result of link building, positive user behaviour and optimised on and off page content.\\nZib Digital points out that building trust and credibility doesn't happen overnight. Just like in real life, authority is earned and built over time. It takes time, patience, commitment, effort and a solid SEO strategy. While paid advertising, social media and other online platforms can generate traffic to websites, the majority of traffic is driven by search engines. Organic search results appear more credible to savvy searchers and receive more clicks than paid advertisements.\\nZib Digital says it's important for businesses to do their research when outsourcing SEO. Many digital agencies offer SEO Melbourne wide, but only a handful do it well. While it is tempting for some digital marketers to choose the most obvious keywords, Zib Digital focuses on not only choosing keywords that are relevant but also profitable.\\nWith more than a decade of experience representing hundreds of SEO clients across a variety of industries to achieve first page results, Zib Digital's approach to SEO is proven to deliver results.

A broker can also provide guidance on a borrower's eligibility for one of a range of government grants and support schemes, including:\\n\\nThe First Home Loan Deposit Scheme (FHLDS) allows eligible borrowers with a deposit as low as 5% to get a loan for an existing property - without paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance.\\nThe First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) is a one-off grant that can go towards buying a newly built home or embarking on a build. Eligibility criteria and grant amounts differ between states and territories. In Tasmania, the grant amount is $20,000 while in Victoria, eligible borrowers can access $10,000.\\nThe New Home Guarantee (NHG) is designed to help singles and couples looking to buy or build a new home. Like the FHLDS, borrowers could access a loan with a minimum deposit of 5%.\\n\\nEven if you're not eligible for a grant, other options might be available. Your broker can help you find the right lending solution to make your homeownership dreams a reality.\\nA broker can also help to secure an indicative pre-approval on a home loan. This means that a first homebuyer can be more confident about putting an offer in as soon as they find the property that suits their needs and budget.\\nLiberty's flexible credit assessment practices mean that they are more able to help first-time borrowers - including those with low deposits, self-employed or poor credit, to secure a home loan to suit their needs.\\nApproved applicants only. Lending criteria apply. Fees and charges are payable.

On August 15, 2021, the Taliban gained control of power in central Kabul and this crippled all business and government infrastructure in the war-torn country, leaving many people to flee to safe heaven and others left waiting for humanitarian assistance. Ahmadzai says, \"The people desperately need of aid right now, and others are at risk of being killed due to political power grab by the Taliban regime\".\\nAhmadzai runs a tech business in Canada and his goal is to one day implement a simple robotic technology idea that can detect and remove landmines, but with the Taliban now in power, the futureÂ\\xa0of such innovation in Afghanistan is uncertain. He says, \"Afghanistan has been through a lot - more than four decades of war and four generations killed\". He adds, \"Our robotic technology is simple; it consists of training the youth and at the same time protecting lives and creating jobs\".\\nLast week, the international community raised more than $1 Billion to support humanitarian aid efforts in Afghanistan, but Ahmadzai states up to now it is unclear how the Afghan needy people will receive this help. He says, \"Thousands of people are still in need ofÂ\\xa0food, water, and medicine, and there is no government and no banks - so how will the Afghan people receive support?\".\\nBut even with the political power grab by the Taliban, there is still no peace which mean more war in Afghanistan\\'s context, explains Ahmadzai. \"We are still seeing lots of protests happening across the country, and the Taliban regime only wants to return the Afghan culture and values to the 90\\'s when they originally favoured power.\"\\nTo learn more about the innovations of Taleam Systems, visit the website: www.taleamsystems.com\\nSource: Taleam Systems\\n'},\n",

The solution transforms traditionally biased interviewing and hiring practices by providing an effective, engaging way for participants to gain realistic experience, applying structured interviewing techniques. The Interviewer Experience was developed in partnership with several FortuneÂ® 100 organizations that are committed to meeting their diversity and inclusivity goals and believe that better interviewing processes are key to achieving those goals. Hiring experts from the partner companies helped create highly authentic scenarios and provided extensive input on areas where bias is most likely to affect hiring decisions. The immersive multimedia simulation allows participants to engage in simulated hiring decisions and tests their learning throughout the exercise, leading to higher quality real-world hiring decisions with measurable reductions in biased outcomes.\\nThe APTMetricsÂ® Interviewer Experience is a self-guided, web-based, multimedia simulation where participants \"sit in\" on different interviewing situations, answer questions about the process, and discover where a particular path of questioning can lead. If the results of the participant\\'s choices are deemed incorrect, they are provided immediate feedback and have the option to re-take a module and choose a different path to fully understand the how and why of the recommended actions. This is in clear contrast to many traditional interview training options that offer simple factual presentations and artificial role-playing.\\n\"We were approached by a couple of our long-term enterprise clients about the possibility of applying our immersive simulation technology, which we\\'ve used so successfully for leadership assessments, to the challenges of structured interview training,\" said John C. Scott, Co-founder and COO at APTMetrics. \"Our clients had significant interest in partnering in new ways to help meet their strategic commitments around diversity in hiring. With the release of our Interviewer Experience solution, we\\'re completely changing the paradigm of interviewer training and truly believe that unbiased interviewing can now be a functional part of every organization\\'s talent acquisition strategy.\"\\nAPTMetrics is the only human resource consultancy that builds world-class talent solutions and is nationally recognized for its employment litigation support services. This combination ensures that the unique HR consulting services and talent management solutions we deliver are inclusive, fair, valid, and legally defensible.

The freeÂ\\xa0educational resource is independent, objective, regularly updated by marketing authorities and welcomes input from the marketing community.\\nIn 2009, members of the recently formed MASB identified a lack of agreed-upon marketing terminology as an impediment to communication between functions and across firms, and a hindrance to accountability. The Common Language in Marketing Project was formed to develop a new educational resource that eliminated ambiguity and encouraged trust and collaboration.\\nThe team consisted of marketing academics and practitioners plus representatives from three supporting organizations with a vested interest in clear marketing communication: the American Marketing Association (AMA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and the Marketing Science Institute (MSI).\\nThe collaboration was a success, and the Common Language Marketing Dictionary (marketing-dictionary.org) was launched in 2011 with a few dozen terms. The focus was on quality over quantity, with an extensive review process for selecting, researching, defining and - if necessary - revising terms through emails and monthly meetings. The results convinced the AMA to merge its online dictionary with the Common Language Marketing Dictionary, adding nearly a thousand terms and definitions.\\nIn his recent Journal of Macromarketing article (Aug. 4, 2021), Dr. John Gaski, Associate Professor of Marketing at Notre Dame University and project team co-leader, explained why corporate financial management supports a marketing dictionary: \"The motivation seems to be simply that better communication within marketing should improve communication between marketing and finance, consequently allowing the more certain accountability that finance seeks in terms of return on marketing investment.\"\\nThe sudden influx of terms gave the dictionary its first boost of recognition, the second came when the website was relaunched on a better platform in 2018 and a social media campaign began withÂ\\xa0Marketing Term of the Week, available via email, LinkedIn and Twitter.\\nAnother boost came when Google began featuring it in search engine snippets for marketing terms. Snippets display a truncated version of the dictionary definition along with the source URL, introducing millions of Google users to the free resource. Marketing professors around the world started including dictionary links in their lessons, as the online University of Phoenix recently began.\\n\"Marketing is a dynamic field, terms are added every year,\" says Dr. Paul Farris, Professor of Marketing Emeritus at the University of Virginia and project team co-leader. \"To stay on top of those definitions and the different ways that they are used, you need an authoritative source.\"\\nWith the guidance of its esteemed co-chairs and the dedication of the project team, this lexicon has grown to more than 1,800 cross-referenced marketing terms and definitions. Having achieved more than 30,000 monthly pageviews organically without paid promotion, the Common Language Marketing Dictionary is thriving, growing and looking forward to many more decades of being that authoritative source.\\nSource: Marketing Accountability Standards Board\\n'},\n",

The regular quarterly cash distribution will be paid on December 8, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2021, and the special cash distribution will be paid on December 23, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 16, 2021.\\nMark Gatto, co-Chief Executive Officer of CIC, said, \"Our portfolio continues to perform solidly and deliver income for shareholders. We are pleased to announce the special distribution to be paid at the end of the year based on CIC\\'s investment company taxable income generated through the course of the year.\"\\n2-to-1 Reverse Stock Split\\nSeparately, CIC announced that, in anticipation of a potential listing of its shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"Listing\"), CIC\\'s board of directors (the \"Board\") approved a 2-to-1 reverse split of CIC\\'s shares of common stock. CIC expects that the reverse stock split will become effective on or about September 21, 2021. As a result of the reverse stock split, every two shares of CIC common stock issued and outstanding will be automatically combined into one share of CIC common stock. There will be no change in the par value of $0.001 per share as a result of the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split will not modify the rights or preferences of CIC\\'s common stock.\\nMichael A. Reisner, co-Chief Executive Officer of CIC, commented, \"As we continue to make progress toward a potential Listing, we believe a reverse stock split will broaden the range of potential investors for our common stock, thereby potentially improving the trading and liquidity of shares to the benefit of all shareholders.\"\\nCIC will further announce details regarding the results of the reverse stock split, including the commensurate adjustments to the forthcoming regular and special distribution per share amounts announced in this press release, following effectiveness of the reverse stock split.\\nShare Repurchase Policy\\nCIC also announced that its Board approved a share repurchase policy authorizing CIC to repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock after the Listing. The number of shares repurchased and the timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at CIC\\'s discretion. The policy may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate CIC to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock.Â\\xa0\\nAs part of the share repurchase policy, CIC intends to enter into a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The 10b5-1 trading plan would permit common stock to be repurchased at a time that CIC might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions. The 10b5-1 trading plan will be administered by an independent broker and will be subject to price, market volume and timing restrictions.\\nNew Distribution Reinvestment Plan\\nLastly, in anticipation of a potential Listing, CIC announced that its Board adopted a new distribution reinvestment plan (the \"New DRP\") and terminated the existing distribution reinvestment plan. The New DRP will become effective upon the Listing and will first apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions payable during the fourth quarter of 2021. Upon the Listing, all shareholders will automatically be enrolled in the New DRP and will receive distributions as declared by CIC in additional shares of CIC common stock unless such shareholder affirmatively elects to receive an entire distribution in cash. There can be no assurance that CIC will be able to complete the Listing in any certain timeframe or at all.\\nWith respect to cash distributions to participating shareholders under the New DRP, CIC reserves the right to either issue new shares or cause the plan administrator to purchase shares in the open market in connection with implementation of the New DRP. Unless CIC, in its sole discretion, otherwise directs the plan administrator, (A)Â\\xa0if the per share \"market price\" (as defined in the New DRP) is equal to or greater than the estimated net asset value (\"NAV\") per share on the payment date for the distribution, then CIC will issue shares at the greater of (i)Â\\xa0NAV or (ii)Â\\xa095% of the market price; or (B)Â\\xa0if the market price is less than the NAV, then, in CIC\\'s sole discretion, (i)Â\\xa0shares will be purchased in open market transactions for the accounts of participating shareholders to the extent practicable, or (ii)Â\\xa0CIC will issue shares at NAV.\\nABOUT CION INVESTMENT CORPORATION\\nCIC is a leading publicly registeredÂ\\xa0non-traded business development company that currently has approximately $1.8 billion in assets.

When IDAP brought us the opportunity to bring our tokenization expertise to the project financing space, we knew this was the next step.\"\\nAlexander Green, Chief Evangelist and Co-Founder of Globacap, commented: \"Globacap\\'s mission is to change the way capital markets operate, completely overhauling the traditional process.

The launch comes as retailers face increased pressure to strengthen their omni-fulfillment capabilities by improving productivity while expanding capacity. Most recently, Porter was Global Head of Stores for Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Previously, Porter was Vice President, Omni-Channel Operations for Walmart Canada.\\nTomorrow Retail Consulting was founded in 2019 by Jordan Berke, former Vice President of e-Commerce for Walmart China. Since then, Berke and team have focused exclusively on digital retail - guiding digital growth strategies, channel development, omni assortments and retail media monetization at some of the world\\'s largest retail brands. Now, as retailers across the industry are facing pressure in the wake of labor shortages and rising wages, the company is launching their new omni-fulfillment division.\\n\"Daryl is one of the most well-respected leaders in the omni-channel space. His hands-on experience engineering profitable omni-operations at major international retailers means he understands the unique opportunities and challenges our clients are facing,\" said Jordan Berke, Founder and CEO, Tomorrow Retail Consulting. \"We are absolutely thrilled to have him join our team.\"\\nPorter started his career pushing carts and went on to manage operations at Walmart\\'s largest stores in Canada. Later as Vice President, Omni-Channel Operations, he spearheaded the retailer\\'s expansion of Online Grocery across the country. Here, Porter launched the Urban Online Grocery Strategy and helped Walmart become the first national retailer to launch native home delivery operations in all Tier 1 CanadianÂ\\xa0cities. He also pioneered a Walmart Canada delivery operation that was based out of a small footprint, semi-automated e-grocery facility. Porter negotiated the retailer\\'s strategic partnership with Instacart, designed and brought to market remote pickup sites and launched store pickup at more than 400 locations. He would eventually run an e-Commerce supply chain in its entirety, having responsibility for all fulfillment and last-mile operations.Â\\xa0Most recently, Porter was Global Head of Stores Anheuser-Busch Inbev, the world\\'s largest brewer - leading their 15,000 stores and helping engineer their digital transformation.Â\\xa0\\n\"The team at Tomorrow Retail Consulting has helped create many of the most successful and most profitable omni operations in the world,\" said Daryl Porter, Senior Partner, Global Omni Operations, Tomorrow Retail Consulting. \"I am delighted to work alongside this talented group to help drive digital change for retailers worldwide.\"\\nTomorrow\\'s unique value proposition is their people - Porter joins Tomorrow\\'s elite team of experienced digital retail executives from Walmart, Target, Kroger, and other successful omni brands.Â\\xa0\\n\"Tomorrow is truly an outstanding partner in the digital retail area,\" said client Oskar Hjertonsson, Founder and CEO of Cornershop, now owned by Uber.Â\\xa0 \"Bringing a talent like Daryl Porter onto the team further enhances Tomorrow\\'s position as a leader in omni strategy and operations.\"Â\\xa0\\nAbout Tomorrow Retail Consulting\\nTomorrow Retail Consulting was created in 2019 from Founder and CEO Jordan Berke\\'s inspiration that retailers globally need guidance on how to turn their digital capabilities into a core advantage.Â\\xa0After spending more than a decade launching and leading e-Commerce for Walmart in China where e-Commerce - and digital retail overall - was approximately five years ahead of most developed markets, Berke observed how Walmart and other retailers in China transitioned to a truly digital-first mindset - transforming stores from retail-only facilities to true omni-channel fulfillment centers.Â\\xa0During his time with Walmart, Berke and team helped bring digital innovation into the physical store experience, through mobile checkout and personalized in-store digital platforms.Â\\xa0They opened dark stores across the country and scaled rapid <1 hour delivery while most retailers were in the early stages of their omni evolution.\\nIn 2019, knowing the retail world outside of China was ready to focus on digital, Berke launched Tomorrow Retail Consulting, a firm dedicated to making digital a core advantage for retailers around the world. Tomorrow Retail Consulting is based in Hong Kong with teams in the US, Canada, and China.

Business as usual will not get us there. We need to jump-start inclusive and deliberate problem-solving that engages all the world's people and institutions in evidence-driven partnerships. The Lens is set to enable this change.\\nToday, The Lens announces the launch of the Collective Action Project - a multi-year initiative to enable open innovation knowledge for solving problems together. Comprising a massive collection of over 134M global patents linked with 236M research publication records and hundreds of millions of genetic sequences extracted from patents, with powerful analytics, and institutional tools, The Lens is the world's largest science and technology resource for both public sector, civil society and businesses, built on open data.\\nDeveloped in consultation with leadership at the WHO, WIPO, CEPI, World Trade Organization, UNEP, the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor of India, and leading universities, and guided by the Lens Equitable Access Program (LEAP), the project will ensure open access to shared innovation knowledge and inclusive institutional uses of the data and tools needed to solve our collective crises under terms that make it a community-supported platform.\\nThis release features the largest increase in patent and scholarly capability data and analysis in Lens' 20-year history, leading to new clarity in global patenting. Using global patent status analysis, Lens has found that of the nearly 14 million granted patents that are currently 'in force' worldwide, almost 99% of them have rights in fewer than 20 countries. Fewer than 1% of patents have any rights at all in countries across the Global South. This observation shifts the narrative around patents towards its original purpose of putting knowledge in the public domain to stimulate innovation.\\nCollective Action needs Connected Actors.\\nScience, however remarkable, does not solve problems by itself. It must be well integrated with many diverse capabilities, and bound by shared incentives and knowledge. These capabilities - including business, law, policy, and more, are typically found in guilds of practice with distinct types of knowledge.Â\\xa0\\nThe Collective Action Project will enable bridging these domain and expertise boundaries and removing roadblocks to science- and technology-enabled problem-solving and the partnering it requires. Building on its newly released Report Builder features, Lens CAP will lead to cooperative mapping of the partnerships, opportunities, risks and trajectories needed to achieve the massive scale and speed we need to cope with crises.\\nSummary of key points:\\n\\nThe Lens launches the Collective Action Project (CAP), a new multi-year initiative to replace closed, proprietary innovation knowledge with open, reusable and shareable public knowledge.\\nDiscovery and analysis of innovation knowledge is a multi-billion dollar industry that uses closed data, charging exorbitant fees to find public knowledge, keeping innovators in silos and excluding most of the world from accessing this knowledge.\\nThe Lens is a global platform that will reverse this situation, dropping costs, saving the public sector 100s of millions of dollars and making 'open' a defaultÂ\\xa0\\nThe Lens Equitable Access Program (LEAP) ensures a level playing field.\\nLEAP guarantees every human free and unsurveilled use of Lens.org and its open data.\\nLEAP guarantees every institution will have access to an Institutional Toolkit with low tiered fees leading to community-supported sustainable open infrastructure.\\nPublic-good institutions in 130 countries across the Global South will get Institutional Toolkits free of cost.\\nThe Lens releases a massive upgrade to provide the world's first integrated open research and patent platform with over 120 searchable fields, powerful analytics, APIs and global patent legal status.\\nNearly 99% of all granted patents are only in force in the richest 10-20 countries. For the rest of the world, these patents are public domain.\\n\\nView the full Press Release, read more about the Collective Action Project or watch the accompanying launch video.

As Zib Digital explains, SEO is a continual process of refinement of a long series of very technical digital items and a continual candid assessment of what people are typing when they search.\\nSEO is the best connection between the declared intent of a customer and the possibility of selling a product or service. Zib Digital says SEO is a powerful part of any digital strategy. The key to understanding this is understanding the data. Google data reveals that for every 100 people that search in Google, 72 will click an organic search result and 65 per cent of those people will click on a website in the first three positions.\\nZib Digital explains that there are many reasons why businesses fail to see the size of the opportunity of SEO Auckland-wide. The typical agency in New Zealand is ill-equipped to complete the technical work required to make SEO a long-term success. As a result, many businesses that have tried SEO fail to build any confidence when results have not been achieved.\\nAdditionally, Zib Digital says an SEO strategy that has been executed with a focus on too many keyword phrases will not yield effective results. Many agencies offering SEO services promise results in under six months and if results do not materialise, owners and executives give up. There is also a general misunderstanding that when a website is built, it is 'optimised for Google'. While there are elements of the technical setup that can help, it is a gradual and consistent process over many months and years that achieves the best results.\\nAs the leading SEO company in Auckland, Zib Digital has built a large and dedicated team of SEO specialists. With depth, diversity and strong leadership, Zib Digital consistently places clients in the top three on Google organic rankings.\\nTo dominate Google search results and make more money, it's time to outsource digital marketing in Auckland to Zib Digital.\\nContact us -Â\\xa0https://zibdigital.co.nz/\\nKatie McAleeseÂ\\xa0+ 64 272 757 059\\nSource: Zib Digital\\n\"},\n",

The new ultrasonic system measures liquids, gases and steam and is approved for operation in ATEX/IECEx ZoneÂ\\xa01. The flow measurement is carried out non-intrusively with ultrasonic transducers mounted on the outside of the pipe. FLUXUS F/G831 has two intrinsically safe (Ex-ia) process inputs for connecting pressure and temperature sensors. This allows the transmitter to directly determine the output mass flow or standard volumetric flow rate.\\nThe new series of instruments has been specially developed for demanding measurement tasks in challenging environments. Inside the hermetically sealed enclosure, a digital signal processor ensures the highest measurement performance. The integrated disturbance correction ensures good measuring accuracy even at unfavourable measuring points. Furthermore, the high-performance processor supports fast switching between two measuring channels. Synchronized channel averaging enables immediate compensation of measured value fluctuations resulting from disturbances of the flow profile due to turbulence or difficult inlet conditions. As with all FLUXUS series flowmeters, the FLUXUS F/G831 ultrasonic transducers are carefully paired at the factory and have temperature compensation according to ANSI/ASME MFC 5M. Both form the basis for absolute zero-point stability and accurate bidirectional flow measurement over a very wide measuring range. At FLEXIM, transmitters and transducers are calibrated independently of each other in a patented process and without the influence of application-related disturbances. This always ensures the highest measuring accuracy in the field, regardless of the application the measuring system is used for.\\nFLUXUS F/G831 offers various protocols for bidirectional communication such as Modbus, Profibus, Foundation Fieldbus and HART. It also offers the option of parameterization and wireless transmission of measured values and internal diagnostic data via WLAN. With the FluxDiag software, the data can be conveniently visualized and evaluated on a notebook or PC.\\nFind out more here.\\nFree webinar!\\nDr. Ingo Nickel, Head of Market Management Chemical Industry at FLEXIM, will present the new flowmeter series in a public webinar on Sept.Â\\xa023, 2021 (two sessions at 9Â\\xa0a.m. and 4Â\\xa0p.m. CET).

Some businesses lean heavily on their eCommerce PPC services to generate new streams of revenue with each passing season or trend.Â\\xa0\\nPay-per-click advertising, or PPC, collectively refers to a group of many different ad types in which an eCommerce business effectively bids on, or \"buys\" specific keywords and then creates any of a variety of ad types to populate a viewer\\'s screen according to a series of managed criteria. When a user clicks on the ad, the advertiser pays the price; hence, pay-per-click.\\nThere are many different types of PPC ads andÂ\\xa0eCommerce PPC campaigns. The classic PPC ad campaign revolves around search ads; these are the ads that populate the top of the search results pages based on the search query. The advertiser bids on the keywords associated with the search, and if certain applicable criteria are met, the ads will then display at the tops of the search engine results pages. Considering the fact that the top three search result listings earn the vast majority of clicks, these are very valuable positions to occupy, especially for competitive keywords.Â\\xa0\\nSearch ads are not the only format of PPC ads available to businesses in the modern eCommerce market. There are also display ads, shopping ads, and video ads as well. In addition, businesses like Amazon, and even some social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, host their own ad management systems as well. For businesses with strong social media followings, the best PPC strategies might involve Instagram or Facebook ads.\\nBecause of the resources that should be allocated to an eCommerce PPC management strategy in order to maximize the return on investment while optimizing quality scores, many online businesses find it is in their best interest to partner with an eCommerce PPC service provider to perform the preliminary research, implement the ad campaign and make continuous, ongoing optimizations that will generate the greatest results.\\n1Digitalâ“‡ Agency has been a leading provider of digital marketing services since its inception in 2012 and delivers highly optimized PPC management strategies to its customers. Their PPC management services involve research, planning, and implementation, as we as continuous optimizations to ad copy, landing pages, and to strategy, adjusting device, demographic, geographic, and even time-of-day- targeting in addition to remarketing and A/B testing, as necessary.\\nFor eCommerce businesses looking for a cost-effective solution for generating revenue associated with more competitive keywords while investing in eCommerce SEO for long-term success, eCommerce PPC management services constitute some of the most lucrative opportunities.

It\\'s said that tequila runs in Monica\\'s blood because of her Mexican heritage and that tequila runs through Alex\\'s bloodstream because he was a tequila fan for a long time before co-founding Siempre Tequila. The inspiration behind the brand comes from Monica\\'s grandmother and great-grandmother, who used to make Mezcal for the family to sip during family gatherings. To quote Alex & Monica; \\'\\'we risked it all, and it was worth it!\\'\\'.\\nAbout Siempre Tequila | \"No celebrity required\" are words this brand stands by. With features in Rolling Stone Magazine, TMZ, Forbes Magazine, and other major media appearances, our Award-winning, 100% agave tequila is handcrafted using mineral-rich volcanic spring water. High-quality ingredients and distillation methods produce complex aromas and flavors, with a finishing technique that makes Siempre exceptionally smooth, naturally sweet, and perfect for sipping. Siempre\\'s structure is feminine meets masculine with a bright, optimistic colorway, and joyful blending that is almost aggressively different from most other tequila brands that tend towards the serious and austere. The illustration style is a blend of traditional Mexican patterns and contemporary tattoo culture. Overall the effect is one of joyful rule-breaking and rebellion.Â\\xa0\\nFor press/media inquiries please contact jason@jmediahouse.com\\nSource: Siempre Spirits Limited\\n'},\n",

In fact, many hardy indoor plants can survive and even thrive despite serious neglect.\\nFor those who tend to be forgetful when it comes to watering, Amazing Graze Flowers recommends the peace lily. They are very tolerant of low light and their leaves will droop when they need a drink, explains Amazing Graze Flowers. The peace lily normally sprouts striking white flowers but won't bloom if they don't get enough light.\\nThe monstera will tolerate all sorts of conditions and won't punish a forgetful waterer, according to Amazing Graze Flowers. The snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue is another great choice for a low-maintenance indoor plant. These hardy plants can survive on monthly watering and can tolerate both direct sunlight and lower light spaces. Amazing Graze Flowers says these plants need a well-draining pot and the soil needs to dry out completely before watering.\\nOn the other hand, for those who are guilty of overwatering, Amazing Graze Flowers recommends the Chinese money plant, which is an incredibly popular gift for the office or home, as it is said to bring good luck, money and prosperity. This plant grows best in a shady spot with weekly watering.\\nAmazing Graze Flowers says one of their most popular indoor plant varieties is the dracaena 'golden heart', which is also known as the happy plant. This plant only requires watering every few weeks and prefers bright filtered light. It will begin to lose its lime colour if it isn't getting enough light.\\nBoutique Melbourne-based floristÂ\\xa0Amazing Graze FlowersÂ\\xa0is known for creating amazing arrangements to suit any occasion from weddings and engagements to birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's Day, corporate events and more.

The effort they have put forth to ensure families have a safe streaming alternative has been exceptional, without their dedication and passion to keep kids safe, we would not have experienced the success we\\'ve seen through this pandemic.

Since the pandemic began, the team has shown tremendous resilience in responding to the call and stepping up to position the company for success.\\n\"I recently had a personal epiphany that to be my best self, not only for me, but for my family and our company, it was essential that I step back and reassess what was most important - my own health and well-being,\" said Mike Lowe, CEO and co-founder of Kidoodle.TV. \"During this personal time, I was able to reflect on my role as CEO and get clear on what matters most.

When a typo is suspected - the customer is alerted and given the option to keep it or correct it. If corrected, the changes are automatically made on the order within Shopify.\\nThe most common email typos include Hotmali.com instead of Hotmail.com and Gamil.com vs Gmail.com. Typoly checks against hundreds of the world\\'s most-used domains and their extensions, totaling tens of millions of possible typo combinations.\\n\"People are in a rush;Â\\xa0it\\'s not uncommon to flip a few characters around. The problem is, when this happens, your customer doesn\\'t receive any form of order confirmation or subsequent updates on their order. By the time they reach out to your support teams, they\\'re already upset for not having heard anything about their order,\" said Wayne McLaughlin, Director of development for AppMazing.\\nThe concept for Typoly arose when a friend of Wayne, an existing Shopify store owner, expressed the frustration that arises from something as small as an email typo occurs and the time and resources consumed by handling the correction. Wayne searched the Shopify community and found other merchants with the same frustration resulting from email typos in orders placed.\\nAppmazing began development on a solution that included months of testing prior to submitting it for Shopify\\'s stringent approval process. The app was approved and published two weeks ago.\\n\"We wanted a solution that would be available to all Shopify merchants, not just to those who are on Shopify Plus,Â\\xa0while also being cost-effective,\" said Wayne.\\nTypoly offers Shopify store owner\\'s a trial, followed by a $9.99 per month subscription. This is the first app of its kind available for Shopify store owners.\\n\"We really set out to make the return on investment decision a no-brainer. Typoly pays for itself with the headache saved even catching just oneÂ\\xa0email typo a month,\" said Wayne.\\nTypoly on Shopify App Store\\nAppmazing is based in Burlington, Ontario, and is currently in the midst of three new development projects for Shopify merchants.\\nSource: Appmazing Inc.\\n'},\n",

This topic will be aired in the online event \"Plastic Recycling Infrastructure: Investment Opportunities in Chile\" taking place this Thursday, September 9. The webinar has been organized by InvestChile, Chile\\'s foreign investment promotion agency, in conjunction with the Chilean Plastics Pact (Pacto Chileno de los PlÃ¡sticos, PCP) led by FundaciÃ³n Chile.\\nChile produces more than 1.2 million tons of plastic per year, of which only 7% is recycled. Of all recycled plastic, 17% is household waste and 83% non-household waste.\\nNew Chilean regulations are generating the need to increase the country\\'s recycling capacity and putting the onus on producers and importers to take responsibility in this area. This new panorama generates investment opportunities in two spheres:\\n\\n\\nCapacity. Chile currently has sufficient capacity to recycle without any problems. However, in light of the target recovery rates set out in the new law, processing capacity will need to increase considerably. For the same reason, a shortfall is anticipated with regard to investment in infrastructure for classification and/or valorization plants.\\n\\nLocalization. Chile\\'s recycling capacity is highly concentrated in one area with some 80% of all the available infrastructure being located in the Metropolitan Region, where the capital, Santiago, is located. It is crucial to expand this capacity throughout Chile, which is 4,200 km (2610 miles) long.\\n\\nThe e-book \"Recycling Infrastructure for Plastic Packaging: Outlook and Opportunities for Investment in Chile\" will be presented during the webinar. This document identifies the opportunities for investing in Chile\\'s infrastructure for recycling plastic containers and packaging. The e-book was developed by InvestChile in conjunction with the Chilean Plastics Pact.\\nIf you would like to participate in the webinar, you can sign up here.\\nPress Contact:\\nFrancisca Schwerter, fschwerter@investchile.gob.cl\\nDenisseÂ\\xa0VÃ¡squez, dvasquez@investchile.gob.cl\\nSource: InvestChile\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tNORTH LOGAN, Utah,\\n\\t\\t\\tSeptember 7, 2021\\t\\t\\t(Newswire.com) -\\n\\t\\nTimeClick, aÂ\\xa0time clock softwareÂ\\xa0company,Â\\xa0published a new blog last Friday regarding this year\\'sÂ\\xa0Labor DayÂ\\xa0observance. Grant Esser, Head of Marketing at TimeClick and writer of the blog, describes the purpose of this holiday asÂ\\xa0\"toÂ\\xa0honor the work and contribution of all workers towards the betterment of our country.\"Â\\xa0\\nLabor Day is always celebrated on the first Monday of September. This year, we observed Labor Day on Monday, September 6.\\nThe blog also explains that this special holiday is federally observed rather than state observed. Because this is the case, most employers, including ones from government, public, and private companies,Â\\xa0will offer the day off to their employees.Â\\xa0\\nHistorically, Labor Day was only recognized for federal employees. Finally, in the 1930s, unions encouraged workers - no matter who their employer was - to strike for the day off. Now, almost all employers observe the day every year.Â\\xa0\\nThe blog then discusses the laws behind Labor Day and holiday time. It states that you are not legally required to give your employees the day off. You can make the decision based on your unique industry and business needs. However, generally, the day is usually taken off for most workers.Â\\xa0\\nSome exceptions to employees taking the day off may include businesses such as restaurants, retail stores. Employees such as policemen, firemen, emergency services, and even state park officials will also most likely still work for the day.Â\\xa0\\nAlong with not being obligated to give your employees the day off, you are also not legally obligated to pay your employeesÂ\\xa0holiday timeÂ\\xa0for the time they don\\'t work, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). However, again, most employers will offer to pay for the holiday time if possible.\\nThen, the blog gives a brief history of Labor Day. Its popularity grew in the late 19th century, and Oregon was the first state to observe it. By the time it finally became federally observed, almost 30 other states were already practicing it.\\nSome common Labor Day activities include hiking, boating, football, and spending time with family and friends with good food.Â\\xa0\\nFinally, the blog gives a look into holiday time tracking in TimeClick. Not only can you track other types ofÂ\\xa0paid time off, you can also add an automatic mass time entry so you don\\'t have to remember to manually pay all your employees.\\nIn reference to his blog, Esser stated, \"We really hope it helps employers understand what to do about their employees on Labor Day.\"\\nSo now it\\'s time to kick back, relax, and enjoy the long weekend. You earned it.\\nTo read the full blog, visitÂ\\xa0https://www.timeclick.com/labor-day-2021-observation-holiday-time-and-more/.\\nSource: TimeClick\\n'},\n",

Research continues to report that the traditional business credit scoring framework often doesn\\'t accurately represent borrower eligibility for small business opportunities and funding.Â\\xa0\\nThis week, Tillful announced the launch of its new free iOS mobile application. Tillful\\'s mobile app is the first in the market to offer a real-time business credit scoring platform that leverages alternative data.Â\\xa0\\nIt makes credit information and business credit scores much more accessible and actionable as well as offers exclusive access to funding for the platform\\'s more than 25,000 existing small businesses.\\n\"We are more committed than ever to ensuring that small business owners get the credit they deserve,\" says Ken So, founder and CEO of Tillful and its parent company, Flowcast, Inc. \"The expansion into mobile was a natural extension of our mission to empower underserved business owners and deliver direct value for our users. We are committed to our mission of increased financial literacy and access to financial products for the small business and founder communities.\"\\nSince launching a year ago, Tillful has facilitated over $10M in business funding for SMEs across the U.S. With over 40 different online lending and fintech partners, Tillful meets the needs of a diverse spectrum of credit profiles spanning industries such as construction, retail, hospitality, logistics, and e-commerce.Â\\xa0\\nTraditional credit scoring systems rely on static data, which can paint an incomplete, imperfect picture of true creditworthiness, often to the disadvantage of already underserved businesses. Alternatively, the Tillful Business Credit Score uses real-time connected bank and transaction data to find cash flow patterns that indicate a more accurate and up-to-date picture of a company\\'s financial profile and creditworthiness as a business borrower. This, in turn, allows Tillful to connect these businesses with the right lending and funding opportunities they need to succeed.\\nTillful\\'s lead Data Scientist Alex Keller explains why their model is different. \"At Tillful, we believe that more inclusive predictive models must begin with explainability and transparency in mind so that lending decision-makers understand the implications of how their credit scoring systems define creditworthiness.\"\\nThe Tillful iOS app is available on the App Store here.Â\\xa0\\nAbout TillfulTillful is a product offered by the same team behind Flowcast, a Series A fintech backed by ING Ventures and Bitrock Capital. Flowcast leverages its patented AI and machine learning (ML) methodologies to create high-performing predictive models for financial institutions that assess risk and enable lenders to automatically optimize credit offerings.

Simply getting the public to know that your company exists is one of the first hurdles that must be overcome.\"\\nEach company will define success differently. It\\'s important to clearly define specific goals and develop the right strategies to meet them efficiently and effectively. Press release distribution is one of several forms of owned media that is unique in its ability to build trust and credibility. Getting a press release published on reputable news outlets creates a sense of trust, especially when backed by other pieces of high-quality content.Â\\xa0\\nThere\\'s also the added benefit of potentially acquiring earned media opportunities through press release distribution. While difficult to achieve, third-party validation is an effective form of social-proofing that inspires confidence and trust in a way that\\'s much more substantial than through owned media, as people often trust what others say about a business more than what the business has to say about itself.\\nPressRelease.com helps CEOs and business leaders improve their targeting and reach through its budget-friendly press release distribution services.

Growing up, he saw both sides of the drug war, \"Being raised in Springfield, cannabis was a part of our neighborhood and cultureâ€” there were always stories about it, good and bad.\" Sellers saw the impacts of the drug war firsthand both in his community and during his time as a correctional officer in Connecticut.Â\\xa0\\n\"I\\'ve come full circle.

Apart from Match Financial\\'s digital RFQ, which offers the perfect solution for NUKK\\'s institutional clients and partners, Match operates sixÂ\\xa0crypto product lines that will be hugely beneficial.\\n1.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0NFT: This offers unique partnerships with leading UK auction houses for 24-hour auction price-fixing and uniquely bridges the two worlds of high-end digital art with real-world physical assets.\\n2.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0OTC: Ability to offer crypto, DeFi and securities token investments with deep liquidity through partnerships with global exchanges and brokers.\\n3.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0Fiat Settlement: Ability to offer UK FCA-regulated fiat gateways and a full suite of global institutional crypto banking with capacity that exceeds 50 million dollars a day.\\n4.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0Card Payments: Facility to provide multi-currency and multi-token wallet management for a truly convertible crypto debit card that can be used at any point of sale, using MasterCard and Visa.\\n5.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0Remittance: Facilitating cross-border fiat-to-fiat payments, completed within 30-60 minutes from Nigeria with the use of our unique crypto rails that deliver an incredibly efficient, superior and cost-effective alternative.\\n6.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0NGO Services: Fulfilling social responsibility by providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief to Afghanistan, Kenya and India.\\nÂ\\xa0\\nNUKK\\'s tier 1 European OTC desk already offers unmatched pricing and settlement times for institutional volumes of the most popular fiat and cryptocurrencies, processed via the company\\'s U.S., European and UK FCA registered businesses. In addition, with the NFT services, NUKK will be able to offer 24-hour price fixing services, which will help eliminate volatility risk. In fact, this NFT product range is the first of its kind to bridge the gap between clients\\' physical and digital assets by providing multiple channels and professional investor networks for a truly diversified private wealth portfolio management.\\n\"The greatest innovation and demand for blockchain and crypto assets are coming from outside of the West. It\\'s coming from impoverished communities on the other side of the digital divide. The top countries for crypto adoption over the past year are Vietnam and Ghana, with Nigeria the leading country per capita for bitcoin adoption. Afghanistan is now ranking 20 on this list.\\n\"A new global economy is emerging. This is what we dreamed of in the crypto industry years ago, and it\\'s finally happening. The market opportunities are growing exponentially and the need to support the redistribution of wealth and access to resources is very real,\" NUKK\\'s head of emerging markets and crypto payments at digital RFQ, Erin Grover, stated.\\nWith the acquisition of Match Financial, NUKK will be able to support ESG models, including partnering with non-government agencies in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian subcontinent, where rapid funds transfer can mean the difference between life and death. Cryptocurrencies can play a key role in aiding these regions, offering more accessible and democratic financial solutions for transparent humanitarian aid.\\n\"We have great hopes for Nukk in its endeavors to lead by example and drive adoption of the SDG pillars amongst our crypto peers. We are very much looking forward to rewarding our shareholders with more positive updates like this in the near future,\" added NUKK\\'s CEO, Emil Assentato.\\nAbout Nukkleus, Inc.\\nNukkleus, Inc.

The US Food and Drug Administration has continued to oversee the life-science industryâ€™s efforts toward new treatments, vaccine boosters, and other work aimed toward abating the pandemic.Booster authorizationThe FDA tweaked the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use of a single booster dose, to be administered at least six months after completion of the primary series. Patients receiving the okay include:patients 65 or olderadults (18 to 64 years old) at high risk of developing severe COVID-19patients 18 to 64 experiencing frequent exposure to the virus which puts them at high risk of serious COVID-19 complicationsâ€œAfter considering the totality of the available scientific evidence and the deliberations of our advisory committee of independent, external experts, the FDA amended the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to allow for a booster dose in certain populations such as health care workers, teachers, and daycare staff, grocery workers and those in homeless shelters or prisons, among others,â€‹â€\\x9d said acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock. â€œThis pandemic is dynamic and evolving, with new data about vaccine safety and effectiveness becoming available every dayâ€‹.â€\\x9dThis EUA applies only to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and not the others currently circulating in the US (Moderna and Janssen).â€œAs we learn more about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informedâ€‹,â€\\x9d Woodcock added.Janssen vaccine EUAThe agency has authorized, under the Janssen vaccine EUA, one additional batch of vaccine drug substance manufactured at the Emergent facility; to date, a total of six batches of Janssen drug substance manufactured at that facility have been authorized.The FDA reportedly conducted a thorough review of facility records and the results of quality testing performed by the manufacturer. Based on this review and the current COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA announced it has concluded the batches are suitable for use.While the FDA commented the agency is not yet prepared to include the Emergent BioSolutions plant in the Janssen EUA as an authorized manufacturing facility, the agency continues to work through previous quality issues there with Janssen and Emergent BioSolutions management.ANDAs in the COVID eraThe FDA revised the guidanceÂ\\xa0Development of Abbreviated New Drug Applications During the COVID-19 Pandemic â€“ Questions and Answersâ€‹ (first published in April). The guidance provides general recommendations to prospective generic drug applicants related to generic drug product development and regulatory submissions in the form of questions and answers that have been received and addressed by the FDA during the COVID-19 public health emergency.The FDA reportedly issued the guidance so that the development of generic drugs and submission of applications can continue during the COVID-19 public health emergency, facilitating continued access to safe and effective generic drugs.False-positive test alertThe FDA sent a letter alerting clinical laboratory staff and health care providers about the potential for false-positive results with Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP and Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP Kits. The letter includes vital information about Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP and Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP Kits including details on potential false-positive results, recommendations for clinical laboratory staff and health care providers, actions the FDA is taking, and instructions for reporting problems with the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 AMP or Alinity m Resp-4-Plex AMP Kits.EUA for prophylaxisThe FDA revised the EUA for bamlanivimab and etesevimab, administered in combination, to include an emergency use as post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms) at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.The bamlanivimab-etesevimab combination is not currently authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent COVID-19 before being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus -- only after exposure to the virus. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together should only be used as post-exposure prophylaxis for specific patient populations, according to the FDA.Further, the FDA advises, prophylaxis with bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together is not an acceptable substitute for vaccination against COVID-19.

Research carried out by the laboratory of institute director Johnathan Whetstine reportedly will be aimed at identifying new indications and potential biomarkers for Salariusâ€™ drug candidate seclidemstat.â€œWe are excited to be working with Salarius to further explore the potential of seclidemstat and LSD1 inhibition in new indicationsâ€‹,â€\\x9d Whetstine said. â€œOverexpression of the LSD1 enzyme is associated with poor prognosis across a variety of cancer types; building on our prior research expertise and knowledge, we will explore the impact of LSD1 depletion and LSD1 catalytic inhibition on the transcriptome in order to better understand the enzymeâ€™s catalytic and non-catalytic functions and the impact of seclidemstat on those functions.â€‹â€\\x9dSeclidemstat (SP-2577) is a novel, oral, reversible inhibitor of lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (also referred to as LSD1, an enzyme with a key role in the development and progression of several cancers.). A number of therapies intended to inhibit LSD1â€™s cancer-promoting activity have been in development recently.According to Salarius, seclidemstat takes a different approach than other LSD1 inhibitors now in development. It simultaneously targets LSD1â€™s enzymatic activity and its scaffolding properties, creating a dual mechanism of action with the potential to offer differential therapeutic activity in various cancer types (including solid tumors). Up to this point, therapeutic activity of LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development has for the most part been limited to hematological cancers and myeloproliferative neoplasms.â€œSeclidemstatâ€™s ability to target the scaffolding property of the LSD1 enzyme has high relevance in several cancer types and could lead to potent inhibition with advantageous therapeutic propertiesâ€‹,â€\\x9d Whetstine commented. â€œInsights into these aspects of LSD1 regulation could significantly impact our understanding about LSD1 function and therapeutic interventionâ€‹.â€\\x9dA Phase I/II clinical trial is now underway exploring seclidemstat as a treatment for sarcomas; the trial reportedly is treating patients with myxoid liposarcoma and other FET-rearranged sarcomas with single-agent seclidemstat and evaluating seclidemstat in combination with the chemotherapy agents topotecan and cyclophosphamide as a potential second- and third-line therapy for Ewing sarcoma, a deadly pediatric bone cancer. Fox Chase is among the nine clinical trial sites now enrolling patients.â€œThis is an exciting opportunity to advance our development of seclidemstat by harnessing the scientific expertise of a renowned cancer research center and one of the rising stars in the field of LSD1 inhibitionâ€‹,â€\\x9d said Salarius CEO David Arthur â€œTo have Fox Chase and a scientist of Dr. Johnathan Whetstineâ€™s caliber involved in this project is a strong validation of our work with seclidemstat. With the help of Fox Chase Cancer Center and Dr. Whetstine, our ultimate aim is to bring new treatment options and hope to more patients and their families fighting hard-to-treat cancersâ€‹.â€\\x9dSalarius recently expanded its seclidemstat clinical program into hematologic cancers, with the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston initiating a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate seclidemstat in combination with azacytidine in myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'All the elements of a clinical trial supply chain are, as the name indicates, closely linked together. Intelligent management of vital study medications and supplies is a formidable challenge, and a misstep could mean cost overruns, trial delays, and failure to get patients the drugs when needed.Oliver Cunningham, vice president of supplies management with Signant Health, discussed the complexities of clinical supply chain management, and one tech solution designed to help streamline the process.OSP: Could you please talk about some of the biggest/most formidable challenges trial professionals face when managing clinical trial logistics?â€‹OC: The biggest risk for a clinical supplies team is not having the right medication on time for patients enrolled in the clinical trial. This is largely due to the lack of supply chain visibility, leading to poor forecasting and planning for ongoing and future needs, both at the manufacturing (program) and site (study) level.Because the risk of a missed patient is so high, clinical supply teams typically resort to creating buffers by ordering more drugs than needed to avoid stock out. However, the demand generated from site recruitment is often unpredictable, and stock is frequently unable to be transferred between sites, resulting in many sites throwing away excess and expired stock â€“ a particular concern for high-cost products with a short shelf life.Â\\xa0OSP: Similarly, what are some of the missteps (or maybe missed steps) logistics managers commonly make?â€‹OC: Far too often, clinical supply teams forecast with spreadsheets that produce limited demand and supplies visibility. They also lack operational standardization, resulting in clinical trial delays, hidden costs, and drug waste. In addition, the nature of spreadsheets requires manual data input, which can lead to erroneous forecasting based on out-of-date data.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0OSP: Please tell us about your SmartSignals solutionâ€”what it is, the applications/environments itâ€™s best suited for, and an overview of the ways it helps study professionals streamline things.â€‹OSP: SmartSignals Supplies is a cloud-based, enterprise solution, designed specifically to streamline the complexities of the clinical supply chain. The Supplies software serves life science companies with easy access to real-time demand and end-to-end inventory visibility within a single source.A central repository for demand and supply metrics means clinical supply teams are more consistent and accurate in how they forecast and plan at both the study and program level. This can be a challenging scenario to imitate with traditional spreadsheets.OSP: Specifically, please share how SmartSignals helps users collaborate and control aspects of their SC.â€‹OC: Managing a clinical supply chain within a single environment establishes a common framework for forecasting, planning, and inventory management. A common framework builds organizational capability and expertise while encouraging collaboration since everyone is homogeneously trained using the same standard processes.OSP: Could you please tell us about capabilities and features SmartSignals offers that other systems and solutions might not?â€‹Oliver Cunningham, VP of supplies management, Signant HealthOC: SmartSignals Supplies is designed to provide customers with the ability to dynamically manage their clinical supply chain with end-to-end visibility and real-time data, so they can properly review current demand estimates, plan mid-study production runs, and accurately revise forecasts and production timings.Weâ€™ve developed these capabilities over 20 years working with small to large pharmaceutical companies. During this time, the environment has evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers. This includes standard integrations with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and distribution partners, scenario planning with version-controlled libraries to optimize supplies at all levels, advanced reporting capabilities with visually appealing, dynamic graphs, and fully compliant audit trails.In addition to our extensive experience, SmartSignals Supplies looks for innovative ways to support our customers with a competitive advantage. These advantages include integrated temperature monitoring, built-in resilience to support new regulatory guidelines, and direct-to-patient (DtP) drug delivery.Â\\xa0OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹OC: SmartSignals Supplies is a cloud-based, software-as-a-service solution, empowering companies of all sizes as it does not rely on an internal IT department to manage.Our software is fully integrated with our SmartSignals RTSM solution, providing real-time logistics and usage data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date data are used at all times in ongoing supplies demand planning. The combination of the two also provides full visibility of the chain of custody for each medication unit and the full reconciliation, returns, and destruction process. This ensures full accountability without the need to reconcile multiple data sources.Â\\xa0Similarly, the management of upstream manufacturing and production processes with in-trial logistics enables Sponsors to consolidate and manage temperature excursion management across the complete lifetime of each medication unit.Further integrations across our suite of products add additional power to the data. For example, patient consents within our eConsent solution provides screening numbers to RTSM, which the solution uses to determine site stock levels and account for new patients randomized.Â\\xa0SmartSignals Supplies also supports the increasingly popular DtP medication supply, which has applications in both traditional, fully site-based trials and hybrid trials where some or all patient assessments are remote. In addition to the added convenience for trial participants, controlling patient-level distribution of supplies from a central pharmacy or local country depot increases drug savings and reduces overall wastage, enabling studies to operate on less overall supplies and in some cases, start earlier.'},\n",

The complexity increases as sponsors are looking to add new sites in new regions, implement adaptive trials and provide direct-to-patient deliveries.Regulatory challengesâ€‹Country-specific regulatory guidance and local legislation need to be taken into account and considered at the earliest planning stage of the trial and closely monitored throughout the study duration. These include the following:Customs regulations (to include requirements to IOR/EOR, import and export licenses and permits, local certifications, and custom clearance timelines)Requirements for a local depot for storage, distribution, and local sourcing activities (a necessity of having a local depot in-country, pharmaceutical license for sourcing activities, licensed local couriers for effective distribution plan)Regulations for clinical trial approvals and reporting to regulatory authoritiesQuality standardsLocal data privacy regulationsPatient protection standards.Operational challengesâ€‹Global clinical trials involve more complicated coordination and planning efforts. Logistics for a global trial is a multistep process that requires coordination across multiple functions, geographies, and activities; import & export, storage, distribution, sourcing, returns, destruction â€“ in the correct order to create a smooth and uninterrupted supply chain that conforms to international and local quality standards. Moreover, these activities need to be synchronized to ensure that the supply flow taking is streamlined. Challenges include:Managing vendor selection and management: including lack of vendors and limited infrastructure in some countries, efficient use of vendors, and mitigating riskTime constraints: import and export issues (e.g. goods stuck at customs and either delayed or not permitted for entry), shipping delays, extended transit duration, tight enrolment timelines are some of the issues that can add complexity to logisticsCost containment: itâ€™s important to manage increased use of resources, delivery strategies (DTS vs via depot) to avoid fines and sanctions due to improperly planned import and export activities, oversupply of investigational products at the depot, and expiration of the useful life of the drugsQuality management: temperature excursion risks, damages (during import, storage, and transportation)Language and cultural barriers: variance and multiple time zones, local supply availability can add another layer of complexityEvolving regulatory environmentWhile multiple challenges exist, none of these are insurmountable. Navigating them successfully requires well-defined and sustainable processes capable of mitigating risks from the beginning to the end of the supply chain process. It also requires knowledge and expertise of those assigned with logistics tasks and local presence in the countries where such tasks need to be performed.OSP: Could you please talk about some of the most complicated aspects of planning and coordinating logistics for an international trial?â€‹LD: Differences in country-specific regulatory requirements and the fact they are constantly changing and regulations related to local logistics need to be constantly monitored. Unexpected changes in the global environment (BREXIT, COVID, etc.) - may lead to the need to take urgent measures to comply with the new realities while avoiding critical delays and unnecessary costs (preparing alternative strategies, responding to change with quick and effective solutions, ensuring quality standards in a new environment).Depending on the country-specific environment, it may be necessary to concentrate on a particular supply chain aspect, such as the engagement of local vendors with certain expertise in regional logistics, use of appropriate shipping solutions and packing materials (e.g., in large countries with multiple climate and time zones more attention should be paid to planning the cold chain management strategy to ensure product quality during prolonged transfers).You also need to consider development of a cost-effective budget that balances both cost and performance with ongoing assessment throughout the study duration. Supply chain management for global trials requires flexibility and capability to adapt to the changing environment, quickly and efficiently.OSP: Please talk about some of the expertise and services your company offers regarding importing and exporting equipment and supplies.â€‹LD: ICONâ€™s Global Logistics business is capable of managing all logistics-related study activities, providing warehousing and distribution services to the clinical trial industry.

The COVID-19 pandemic was an opportunity to showcase our adaptability in terms of carrying on business as usual. We constantly monitored coronavirus restrictions per each country of operations (including flights, transportation service availability, lockdowns, etc.) which allowed for timely decision making, the adoption of alternative options and helped to avoid any disruptions.Quickly reacting to clientsâ€™ requests following local restrictions and sites closeouts due to the virus, we have added direct-to-patient (site-to-patient) supply capabilities to our services offerings in a number of countries we cover. With the increase of vaccine trials, we can offer ready-to-plug-in infrastructure and expedited timelines for gaining access into particular countries under our coverage.When it came to our internal operations (in particular, Depot and Distribution Services department) - we knew that some staff (logistics coordinators, drivers, and warehouse workers) are unable to perform their services virtually and had to be on-site for the uninterrupted logistics activities.With the dual goal in mind of efficiently managing the studies without delays and ensuring the safety of our employees, we developed and implemented a shift-based work schedule, adding transportation coverage for our staff, providing protective materials and equipment, and continue to monitor the health and safety of our employees for the duration of the pandemic.OSP: Do you have any key pieces of advice for trial teams looking to make logistics aspects of a global trial as smooth as possible?â€‹LD: Early involvement of logistics experts in the clinical trial planning process and development of a supply strategy is a critical step to ensure a global trial runs smoothly. Communication is the key and involving logistics experts in study design planning would be beneficial to ensure a smooth and efficient supply chain process.Collection of detailed information on the supply chain needs of the sponsor and study at the earliest possible stage will contribute to early understanding of the scale, cost, and timelines of the logistics project.Important aspects to be considered:Putting in place duly documented agreements between all parties involved into the project (Sponsor, vendors, logistics, and other study teams)Constant communication throughout the project between study teams and logistics parties involved regarding changes, issues, and potential requests.OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹LD: A core supply planning structure must be in place and carefully evaluated to ensure clinical trial success:Availability of documented global processes that regulate each aspect of logistics for clinical trials: extensive global standard operation procedures (SOPs) to ensure compliance and harmonization, detailed processes and defined process maps should be in place.Development and use of appropriate technology that connects the clinical trial supply chain stages and facilities globally and provides the supply chain better visibility.Appointment of a single source of logistics project information for study team members.Constant analysis of risks, search for opportunities, and introduction of improvement actions.'},\n",

              "  'D': \"When weighed against an onsite trial, a decentralized study offers a number of benefits, for researchers and patients alike. However, some of those appealing aspectsâ€”such as enabling the participants to remain in the comfort of their homesâ€”can also lead to challenges (for example, planning to get trial meds and supplies to and from those homes).Ariette van Strien, president of Marken, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma on how planning a decentralized trial differs from onsite in terms of logistics, and what factors need to be weighed in order to maximize chances of success (and avoid snags).OSP: Could you please share some of the key ways in which a strategy for a new onsite trial differs from that for a decentralized/virtual trial?â€‹AVS: The logistics strategy for any clinical trial is largely underestimated. When considering a decentralized trial, you need to look at the entire protocol design differently. The protocol is set up in a different way because you need to consider which visits can be done virtually depending on the clinical and biological assessments that need to be completed.There are some significant advantages to decentralized trials. First, you do not need the same number of investigator sites as with a brick-and-mortar trial. That is an interesting differentiator. If you move to decentralized trials, you can go much larger from a geographical perspective because the travel will be reduced for the hybrid approach or avoided almost entirely for virtual trials.Another key differentiator is how do you attract patients to your trial? Typically, an investigator would look at their existing patient database, but with the decentralized model, you suddenly can go much more extensive and probably attract a whole other client or patient base than previous trials.There should also be higher patient retention with decentralized trials because the inconvenience or disruption to the patient's life is more minor. However, you will work with other partners to include the telehealth visits, potentially adding costs to your trial.Overall, I believe we will see more hybrid trials. We have seen a move towards the hybrid approach, and we're not going back. That said, while some want to stay with a purely decentralized trial, they do not accommodate every therapeutic indication. It's critical to understand that you always need to have the visits conducted in a hospital or clinic with some therapeutic indications.OSP: What are some of the things a trial team needs to keep in mind when incorporating direct-to-patient services in a study?â€‹Ariette Van Strien, president, MarkenAVS: One of the most important aspects of any direct-to-patient trial is understanding that the drug needs to be delivered and, in many cases, a nurse needs to be at the patient's home for drug administration, especially collecting vital signs early on. If you have one or two trials doing that, that's fine, but when you reach 20,000, 30,000, or 40,000 direct-to-patient deliveries and 40,000 nurse home visits per month, it's important to have an experienced logistics partner.For example, consider a direct-to-patient trial in Latin America. You can have one site in Sao Palo, but you have your patient 4,000 miles away, at the other end of Brazil, and need to deliver the drug. I think that is vastly underestimated. Patients are not just in the suburbs of a main city. Trial teams have the advantage of including a much larger patient pool, but they need to consider what that means for the logistical challenges. We have seen many remote areas in these larger countries, and that's a big challenge Marken is solving.Other logistical challenges of a direct-to-patient trial include coordination to avoid the nurse and driver being at the patient's home simultaneously. You have to precisely coordinate so you can deliver the drug to the patient's home. What do you do if there's a temperature excursion? What do you do if the nurse already did the blood draw, centrifuged it, and then left the samples with the patient until the driver picks them up? Can you deliver the drug and have a more straightforward way of looking at the temperature's integrity?We're looking at all of that to continue to simplify the logistics, even to the point that our UPS drivers can pick up any box from any patient in the middle of the street because they have a QR code on the package, and it can be scanned. We're going really far in trying to find new solutions, but the logistics are often largely underestimated by trial teams.OSP: Why is a clear line of communication with patients an important part of a logistics plan?â€‹AVS: A clear line of communication starts with the investigator. If you want the patient engaged in these new trials, they need to understand what that means, who will deliver the drug, and who will pick up the samples. It's not the same anymore as when you're in a clinic at a hospital, and you have a nurse doing it all. It's vital that in the informed consent, it's already written who the provider will be and what they will do so that the patient feels at ease.Communication between the doctor and patient is also critically important in any clinical trial, in any medical setting. The trust factor is a massive part of the outcome of the clinical trial. Patients also need to trust the logistics company chosen and understand that it is an extension of either the physician, the manufacturer, where the drug will be delivered, and that the nurse is as qualified as the one in the clinic. Creating this early trust is critical for patients not to drop out of a trial.OSP: Similarly, what are some of the risks inherent in not properly planning for streamlined patient communications?â€‹AVS: We saw it in some cases where, mainly in a pediatric trial, the parents were so nervous, they were watching every single step of what the driver and nurse were doing. That created a considerable stress situation for their child. When a person is sick and participating in a clinical trial, there is already a high stress level, so how you set it up can avoid a lot of incidences and critiques.At the beginning of any clinical trial logistics plan, the best communication is the key to success. Without clear communication, patients don't feel as comfortable. In a hybrid or decentralized trial, that could result in the patient making mistakes, and they could get excluded from the trial because they weren't in compliance with the protocol design.OSP: Could you please tell us about your Patient Communications Center (PCC) â€”what it is, how it works, key capabilities, and how it differentiates your company's logistics solutions package from other organizations?â€‹AVS: Marken's Patient Communications Center is in three global locations: Philadelphia, US; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Ciudad de MÃ©xico, Mexico. We launched in Philadelphia because most of these direct-to-patient, decentralized or hybrid trials, started in the United States.We now have this direct communication globally so we can support 14 different languages. Our Patient Communications Center explains to the patient where the driver is, what the driver will be delivering, the location of the nurses, and how each will communicate. If a patient has a question, shows any symptoms linked to their treatment, or feels insecure, they can call us, and we can direct their inquiry immediately back to their investigator site.Having this open communication with the patients so that they feel that they can call and ask any question is critically important. Patients can trust us as an intermediary between themselves and the physician. Our Patient Communications Center is about caring for the patient along each step of the protocol.OSP: What are Marken's plans for growing its logistics and patient communications capabilities?â€‹AVS: We are brainstorming how we can further develop our Patient Communications Center. For example, as medical devices such as blood pressure monitors and spirometers become more widely used in virtual trials, we are exploring how we can provide assistance and answer any questions a patient may have. We want to expand our Patient Communications Center further to offer even closer support to a patient.As hybrid and virtual trials continue to grow, Marken is committed to staying one step ahead. Not just logistically but also by providing caring support to each patient on their journey.\"},\n",

              "  'C': 'According to a leader from the health engagement solutions firm, intelligent use of technology tools can add patient-centricity and realism to a study.',\n",
              "  'D': 'Traditionally, researchers seek to isolate their studies and the subjects from any variables and intrusions. However, removing research from the â€˜real worldâ€™ completely can create a number of unexpected issues and prevent a study from yielding the best, most accurate results possible.Francesca Rinaldo, senior vice president of clinical product and innovation with Sharecare, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about how removing all traces of the real world might not be the best idea, and how technology can be harnessed to bring back context and perspective.OSP: Typically, a study occurs in a lab environment, isolated from the outside world and free from most variables. Could you please talk about why this is the case, and how it benefits researchers?â€‹FR: Medicine is steeped in tradition, and the rituals of the ages extend to healthcare research as well. One of the foremost rituals in medicine in general--and certainly in healthcare research--is provider-centricity.In other words, regardless of the nature of research, historically it was conducted in a manner that orbits the institution. Clinical assessments were done in the exam room, laboratory follow-up was completed and brought to the appointment or compiled through the medical record, referrals were conducted and faxed back, and patient-reported outcomes are documented in notebooks that were photographed or dictated to the institution.Perhaps, at one point, this centripetal nature of research made sense; clinical technologies often lacked interoperability (for a long time, the Veterans Affairs system was one of the few with integrated electronic medical records), and consumer technologies often lacked sophistication and reliability. As such, provider-centricity was a matter of fidelity and veracity.There are other practical reasons for institutions conducting trials isolated from the outside world. Higher levels of control, in terms of the variables influencing patient health, tend to increase effect sizes of interventions, while also augmenting the internal repeatability of specific findings. Increased effect sizes push up the statistical â€œpowerâ€\\x9d of a study, which in turn reduces the required enrollment to prove a hypothesis. Reducing the required enrollment decreases overhead and variable costs associated with running the trial, and almost always also decreases the time needed to run the trial.So, the net outputs of isolated clinical trials, from a theoretical and statistical standpoint, are studies that--taken at face value--appear to yield higher magnitude findings at a lower cost in less time.OSP: How does such an isolated environment stand to impact a patient? What aspects (included, or omitted) might be impacting a patient and their study experience?â€‹FR: From the patient standpoint, there are both advantages and disadvantages to provider-centric studies isolated from the real world. The advantages relate to simplicity: When the majority of the study takes place in a singular context, patientsâ€™ experience in the research can be somewhat streamlined. Everything they will do related to the trial either takes place at--or refers back to--a brick-and-mortar clinical setting they can plug into their GPS.Typically, they will not be asked to do much in terms of data collection outside that setting. What data is collected is collated either in the brick-and-mortar setting itself or via phone calls where the onus is on the researchers.However, there are numerous setbacks associated with research limited to institutional settings as well. The first is associated with differences in healthcare access. Individuals who are unable to routinely come to the institutional setting due to any number of reasons will be necessarily excluded from the study, even if they want to participate.As another example, inadequate insurance coverage for research visits can impose a financial burden on patients that may dissuade their participation. Or, lack of transportation to and from the site (including gasoline and parking costs) can make attendance infeasible, unfavorable, or impossible. For patients participating in observational trials, these exclusions may be disappointing.For those participating in interventional trials--such as for oncologic therapies, where the trial medicine may be the best available treatment for an end-stage condition, the exclusions can be devastating. Further, institutional settings give researchers a rich snapshot at best. Health is a far more continuous and rich variable than a single clinic visit can elucidate.OSP: How can sites and sponsors evaluate the tech they use and determine what works best in terms of patient engagement, and what should be changed?â€‹Francesca Rinaldo, senior VP of clinical product and innovation, SharecareFR: The first metric for technology evaluation that sites and sponsors should assess is reliability. The technology of interest--be it legacy software, or a new cutting-edge sensor--must demonstrate accurate and repeatable (precise) measurement of the outcome of interest. These technologies must be calibrated to commonly accepted standards in the field of interest: for example, defining the appropriate planes and angles when using an accelerometer to assess the range of motion.Second, sites and sponsors should analyze the dynamism of a technology. Ideally, new technologies collect data continuously or regularly. The intervals of data collection should be compared to the needs of the study; reliable data that is insufficiently granular or is collected in a discretized way may not serve the requirements of the research methods, even if the data itself is high-quality.Third, sites and sponsors should evaluate the interoperability of a technology. New devices and modalities ought to be integrated readily and/or easily into standard research platforms. Without ease of integration, the routine use of new technologies becomes unrealistic, consuming undue time, labor, and expense.OSP: Please share some examples of study technology that strikes a good balance between patient comfort/ease of use, and being able to get good results for the study team.â€‹FR: Technologies harnessing the power of consumer smartphones offer enormous potential to combine usability and convenience for participants with rich, real-world data for researchers.One such example is a pilot study in which researchers used the Smart Omix platform to predict the likelihood of seasonal allergy exacerbations. By integrating seamlessly with participant smartphones, researchers were able to extract geolocation data including humidity levels, pollen counts, and air quality indices while simultaneously collecting response data on the emergence of symptoms through an accessible survey tool.This manner of data collection required little of participants beyond a short questionnaire, while also collecting continuous and comprehensive data about the environmental conditions to which they were exposed. Using a number of proprietary patient engagement and reward modules, the study was also able to retain 99% of the 2,000 recruited participants for 365 days.Another example was a feasibility study that used a series of digital biomarkers to predict symptom flares of myasthenia gravis, a rare condition. In this study, investigators collected data on participant behaviors including physical activity levels, and linked them to self-reported emergence of symptoms. They also asked participants to complete custom electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) tasks like video and voice recordings. It provided another instance in which rich, continuous data was compiledâ€”data that would not be accessible through traditional, institution-centric studiesâ€”and created empowering opportunities for participants to gain objective insight into their own management of the disease.OSP: Could you please share some of the solutions Sharecare offers for clinical research/drug development clients?â€‹FR: Simply put, we are taking the best of our existing tools â€“ engagement, cross-platform integrations, and clinical validation â€“ and directing them towards clinical research. Smart Omix, our flagship research solution is accelerating the world of decentralized real-world research.Through a robust, scalable technology platform, Smart Omix is able to reimagine traditional methods and uses of real-world data collection. It does so through four powerful, yet intuitive steps that are embedded in the research platform: build, launch, manage, and analyze. Each of these steps contains numerous solutions within it, such as custom survey builder tools, cloud-based data collection warehouses, and sophisticated artificial intelligence tools capable of transforming raw data into impactful findings.Accordingly, the innovative and multi-dimensional Smart Omix platform can better synthesize the broader influences on health and well-being than can institutional data alone. For example, as I mentioned previously, Smart Omix can extract data on patient behaviors such as activity levels and sleep time. It can also interpolate data related to the environment in which patients live such as pollen counts, humidity levels, or the presence of toxic chemicals (like asbestos or wildfire smoke).All of these real-world data are critical for researchers and drug developers interested in understanding how their interventions will fare â€œout there.â€\\x9d Of course, this understanding is critical to both the impact of research studies (since those that cannot be replicated â€œout thereâ€\\x9d tend not to curry much long-term favor) and the profitability of prospective therapies (since those that do not exhibit the desired outcomes in real-world environments tend not to be reimbursed by cost-conscious payors).OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹FR: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced researchers to rethink their institution-based models out of necessity. Many institutes shut down or deferred projects temporarily, lacking the infrastructure, labor, technology, or training to operate remotely.But, some embraced the opportunity to declare themselves at the cutting-edge, conducting research visits through telehealth and monitoring study outcomes through virtual means. Quickly, it became clear that these methods were feasible, tolerable, and even advantageous.As such, conducting clinical trials in a decentralized manner will no longer be a â€œnice-to-have,â€\\x9d but a â€œneed-to-have.â€\\x9d Researchers should view data not merely as â€œwhatever is obtainable,â€\\x9d but rather, as an invaluable asset that can be drawn from a variety of rich sourcesâ€”provided they have the right platform in hand. Thus, for researchers seeking to become early actors in the shifting paradigmâ€”for those seeking to unlock the potential of decentralized real-world clinical research for their own practiceâ€”Smart Omix provides the keys.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Designing a clinical trial is a challenging prospect, but when the condition at the center of a study is a rare disease, sites and sponsors must consider an additional level of complexity. Patients living with rare and orphan diseases frequently deal with unique symptoms and limitations that must be taken into consideration at the design stage.Outsourcing-Pharma checked in with two leaders from clinical research organization ICON about what it takes to succeed in designing an effective rare-disease trial:Will Maier (vice president of rare disease and drug development sciences)Scott Schliebner (clinical executive, strategic advisor, and patient advocate)OSP: Could you please share an overview of trends in the rare disease clinical research arena? Are we seeing an increasing number of such studies, and in what ways do the recent changes in the field (including those created or accelerated by COVID) compare to more traditional therapeutic areas?â€‹ICON: Drug developers in the rare disease sector often encounter flexible regulatory pathways, as many rare diseases are fatal and have a high degree of unmet medical need and no alternative treatments available to patients. This has created a favorable drug development landscape whereby clinical development may require fewer patients; smaller overall clinical trials; lower overall clinical development costs; and higher chances of ultimately receiving marketing authorization compared to other more common indications.Additionally, patient groups and patient advocacy efforts have created a grassroots infrastructure for many rare diseases by establishing patient registries and natural history studies, by developing integrated patient communities, and by raising funds to support research themselves. This has helped to reduce or eliminate some of the more common hurdles to developing a drug for a rare disease, and I believe we are seeing an increase in rare disease clinical research as a result of these various factors.OSP: Please offer some of your thoughts on why incorporating patient voices in study and protocol design helps patient participants, and how the practice benefits the trial teams.â€‹Will Maier, VP of rare disease and drug development sciences, ICONICON: Incorporating patients into clinical trial design is critical to developing realistic, feasible studies. Including the patient voice and perspective in the early study design phase provides drug developers with important input and feedback from a clinical trialâ€™s ultimate stakeholders â€“ the patients themselves.Incorporating this important â€œend-userâ€\\x9d or â€œconsumerâ€\\x9d input results in studies that enroll more rapidly; it creates studies with fewer screen fails; it ensures more patients actually complete the study and do not drop out mid-study due to overly burdensome study requirements. Ultimately, this accelerates clinical development, reduces the cost of developing new treatments, and brings medicines to patients faster.We have developed a tool to facilitate sponsor/patient interactions, and to help sponsors assess the burden of a prospective clinical trial prior to finalizing and opening the study to enrollment. This stakeholder feedback tool is designed to help reduce the burden of clinical trials and thereby facilitate greater access for all patients, regardless of their geography and SES factors.OSP: Soliciting and incorporating patient perspective and voice in trial/protocol design is challengingâ€”could you please share some of the ways in which this process is even more challenging when rare/orphan diseases are the condition at the center of a trial?â€‹ICON: Clinical development is a difficult and highly regulated process. Conducting clinical trials in common, less complex disease states has its own challenges, but when clinical development moves to rare diseases, the hurdles become exponential. For many rare diseases, there is great variability in the natural course of disease; variability in the standard of care for patients, or perhaps no standard of care at all.Pressure testing a new clinical trial design with rare disease patients is critical. Many rare diseases are genetic in nature or occur in children, thereby requiring the involvement of parents, caregivers, and often the entire family in a clinical trial. With very few, geographically dispersed patients, we often donâ€™t fully understand the natural course of a rare disease, making it challenging to establish baselines to measure the effectiveness of new therapies. Further, many rare diseases are multi-disciplinary in nature, requiring a diverse group of medical experts to help diagnose and manage the particular condition.OSP: What are some ways study teams might fall short in their efforts to include input and perspective from rare disease patients, and what might be some of the negative impacts on a trial if they do so?â€‹ICON: A lack of understanding as to how, and when, to engage patients in the clinical design process. Often a lack of time to do so or a fear that including patient input will slow down the protocol development phase or result in feedback from patients that is not actionable. Difficulty gaining consensus on a protocol, and difficulty including layperson/patient perspective within an otherwise medical and scientific collaboration.Impacts include:less appealing studylower enrollment rateshigher drop-out rates and lower participant retentionhigher screen-fail rateslengthened overall clinical development timelineshigher overall development costsdecreased buy-in from the ultimate stakeholders: the patients themselves.OSP: How might a study team utilize data sources and informatics to bring about better design?â€‹Scott Schliebner, clinical executive/strategic advisor/patient advocate, ICONICON: Leverage diagnostic claims data; pharmacy claims data from both specialty and hospital pharmacy systems; procedural claims data â€“ all can be used to illustrate what a patient journey looks like and what baseline health care utilization looks like for a given rare disease.Understand the patient population better via demographics, healthcare utilization levels, SES factors. Leverage natural history data to select endpoints, eligibility criteria, and expected levels of efficacy. Historical enrollment rate data and site performance data can help support projections around trial parameters such as number of countries to be selected; which countries to be selected; number of sites to participate; expected enrollment rate per month; and overall enrollment durationOSP: Decentralizing a trial is more than just sending patients home. Could you please share some of the technology tools trials can use to help bring DCTs to rare disease patients?â€‹ICON: Decentralizing a trial involves using some of the technology and tools available to us to create a clinical trial that is less site-based and is more focused on bringing a study directly to patients. These include:home health care nursingtelehealth direct-to-patient drug shipmentmobile health platforms to administer ePROseSource direct EHM/EMH data collectionBluetooth-enabled devices for remote data capture.OSP: What are some things trial teams should keep in mind when weighing disease burden and treatment impact?â€‹ICON: Consider the selection of endpoints â€“ are they satisfactory to regulators and patients? Consideration of unmet medical needs and patient motivation to participate in a clinical trial. Ensure that disease variability amongst patients doesnâ€™t result in selection bias.OSP: How can ICONâ€™s Rare Diseases Advisory Committee (RDAC) help rare disease studies?â€‹ICON: Our external RDAC is comprised of a group of rare disease patients, advocates, parents, and caregivers, assembled to provide a diverse yet holistic view of rare disease communities. The RDAC actively partners, and guides, ICONâ€™s Center for Rare Diseases as we strive to create innovative patient tools, as we seek to understand the patient perspective, and as we ensure we design and conduct clinical trials that are realistic for families.The RDAC was critical in the development of our recently released Patient-Centric Trial Development Toolkit, a first-of-its-kind open-access tool for sponsors and patients to be able to assess the level of study burden prior to a clinical trial being opened.'},\n",

Our hope is the clinical trials will confirm that CNP-201 can help eliminate the potentially fatal health risks associated with patients who have a peanut allergyâ€‹.\"CNP-201 is a biodegradable nanoparticle that encapsulates purified peanut protein extract and is administered via intravenous infusion.

The organization estimates that about 32m people total suffer one or more food allergies.However, peanut allergies are among the most severe, and potentially deadly, food allergies.

However, in-home visits to patients require trained, talented, and dedicated health professionals to move important research forward.Lisa Taxin Portner is a physician assistant that lends her expertise to decentralized trials, on behalf of Hawthorne Effect. The decentralized trial services firm labels the physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals that facilitate decentralized trial visits â€œHawthorne Heroesâ€\\x9d in recognition of their hard traveling to patient homes to conduct visits and perform much-needed tests and checks that technology alone cannot handle. She spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about her work, what led her to the challenging work, and what it takes to be a Hawthorne Hero.OSP: How did you decide on a healthcare careerâ€”is it something youâ€™ve been interested in since you were a kid, or were you inspired to jump in a bit later?â€‹LTP: I was inspired to jump in a bit later. I didnâ€™t have an interest in science at all and my undergraduate degree actually was in fine art. It wasnâ€™t until my father was diagnosed with a brain tumor and passed away at age 56 that I became interested in medicine.I had been living in New York starting a career as a fabric stylist but ultimately decided to move back to Philadelphia to be with him during his last few months. This is where my medical journey began. I decided to go to x-ray school and there, I met a physician assistant. I realized that was what I wanted to do but needed to take all of the science prerequisites to get into physician assistant school and am very proud to be in the first class of PAs from Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.OSP: Please tell us about your education and career path, and how that took you to your current gig with Hawthorne Effect.â€‹LTP: After graduating from Thomas Jefferson University as a physician assistant, I moved to Florida specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation. During that time, AstraZeneca began looking for educators and clinicians to bring onto their sales team. They recruited me to work for them, which took me on a completely different career path.The majority of my career ended up being in clinical sales. My position as a neurological consultant for a medical device company where I fitted splints on patients in their homes, at the rehab hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or physical therapy clinics.Little did I know then, but this role would help prepare me to become a Hawthorne Hero (Hawthorne Effectâ€™s robust specialty network of multi-disciplinary medical professionals). Though this was my first introduction to meeting patients in the home, I later worked for a long-term acute care hospital and in population health, where I was constantly traveling and evaluating patients.Fast forward to 2020 when I first started working with Hawthorne Effect. I had a friend who met Jodi Akin (founder/CEO) the previous year and introduced me to the company. I was immediately attracted to Jodiâ€™s model of decentralizing trials by providing in-home care since this was something I did my entire career and was very comfortable with.OSP: Could you please share what a typical workday is like as a Hawthorne Hero once you've been assigned a trial?â€‹Lisa Taxin Portner, physician assistant, Hawthorne EffectLTP: The typical workday begins the night before the trial. I make sure I have everything I need in my backpack to complete the evaluation(s), I review which trial visit criteria are being collected, which labs will need to be drawn and I gather all of my paperwork together to eliminate time at the site. Depending on if I am driving directly to the patientâ€™s home or flying, I calculate my travel time, which may include transfers, car rentals, or Uber arrangements. It also involves dropping blood samples off at the lab post-visit.I then travel to the patientâ€™s home (or other location like a hotel room or nursing home) to conduct medical history, medication reconciliation, physical examination/ vitals, trial assessments (which I have completed certifications for) and blood draws. This usually takes around one to two hours.From there, I drop off the specimen and head home. After the visit is complete, I organize my notes and make sure everything is completed and written out according to the trial requirements then scan it all back to Hawthorne Effect so our partners can quickly receive data.OSP: How has the COVID-19 impacted your Hero work, and have the effects changed as the pandemic has progressed the past year and a half?â€‹LTP: I started in August 2020 in the middle of the pandemic, therefore, I havenâ€™t experienced much of a shift in trial visits. Since Hawthorne Effect meets patients where itâ€™s most convenient for them, we havenâ€™t seen failed visits or increased dropouts due to COVID either.OSP: What are some of the aspects you find most challenging?â€‹LTP: There honestly isnâ€™t anything I find challenging! Hawthorne Effect coordinates all logistics before I even head to the site. Everything is thought through and taken care of â€” all I need to do is show up!OSP: What aspects are most rewarding?â€‹LTP: I find the patient and family reactions to be one of the most rewarding parts of this job. Patients and their families are always so surprised and grateful for how convenient Hawthorne Effect makes the process and that excitement/gratitude is a reward in and of itself.OSP: Could you please share any advice for someone that might be considering a career as a Hawthorne Hero?â€‹LTP: Being a Hawthorne Hero is a rewarding experience and my advice to anyone considering it is to do it! This does require some level of flexibility and you must be comfortable going into a patientâ€™s home, which is not the usual medical office environment. Many times I am drawing labs at the kitchen table or conducting assessments in the patientâ€™s bedroom.Youâ€™ll meet people from all walks of life in completely different locations. Itâ€™s also important to establish a good rapport early on with your patients and make sure they feel comfortable throughout the entire visit.OSP: Finally, Hawthorne Effect calls you and your network â€œHawthorne Heroesâ€\\x9dâ€”what do you think about the field is heroic, and are there other Heroes you might like to give a shoutout toâ€‹LTP: I looked up the definition of a hero and while I do not think of myself as someone doing anything extraordinary, I truly believe to our patients, we are heroes. Hawthorne Effect has been able to deliver something remarkable by bringing comfort and ease to clinical trials so more patients can participate.As a Hero, weâ€™re doing something for the patientâ€”not for ourselvesâ€”and it helps me know that other families donâ€™t have to go through what mine did with my father. As for shout-outs, Iâ€™d like to shout out Emmy, Dexter, and Jerome Tonog, MD, with whom Iâ€™ve worked closely and that help with all my planning.\"},\n",

              "  'D': 'A multinational survey commissioned by pharmaceutical firm Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) reveals that the majority of cancer doctors, surgeons, and specialists believe that immunotherapy is likely to have a positive impact on the treatment landscape, when it comes to patients with earlier-stage cancers, regardless of pre- or post-surgery status. The survey checked in with more than 250 cancer care providers in the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, and France currently treating patients diagnosed with Stage I to Stage III disease, across eight different types of cancer.While the healthcare providers responding to the survey question said they are more satisfied with current treatments in cancers where earlier options are well established, the majority of respondents expressed enthusiasm regarding the potential of employing immunotherapy in earlier-stage cancers.Michele Maio, director of medical oncology and immunotherapy for the University Hospital of Siena in Italy, said consideration of immunotherapy is in line with the oncology fieldâ€™s perpetual interest in new and elevated solutions.â€œCancer recurrence often marks the transition from curable to incurable disease and can be life-altering for patients, which is why we continually investigate ways to improve upon the standard of careâ€‹,â€\\x9d Maio said. â€œOptimizing cancer treatment in its early phases, before the disease returns or spreads, represents a significant opportunity and unmet needâ€‹.â€œResearch with immunotherapy in these settings is growing, and the survey results announced today reinforce that a majority of healthcare providers surveyed are enthusiastic about its future potentialâ€‹,â€\\x9d Maio added.Jonathan Cheng, BMS senior vice president and head of the oncology department, remarked that the field of oncology care has seen notable changes in recent years.â€œOver the past decade, immunotherapy research has evolved, starting with a focus on metastatic cancers, and more recently, expanding to explore the role of these treatments in earlier stages of the diseaseâ€‹,â€\\x9d Cheng said. â€œWe hope that by addressing cancer in earlier stages, when the immune system may be more responsive and intact, immunotherapy may have the potential to prevent recurrence and ultimately lead to patients living longerâ€‹.â€\\x9dTreatment for cancers in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or peri-operative settings frequently consists of chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, chemoradiation therapy, and (increasingly in a subset of tumors) immunotherapy. The survey pinpointed several trends on current use, satisfaction, and drivers of treatment choices in earlier-stage cancers.For example, providers surveyed do not always use treatment beyond surgery: The majority of HCPs surveyed report that they â€œsometimesâ€\\x9d use neoadjuvant (62%), adjuvant (55%), or peri-operative (54%) treatments for patients with earlier stages of cancer, highlighting the opportunity for earlier intervention.Also, the care providers surveyed indicate they are more satisfied with current treatments in cancers where earlier options are well established. Six out of 10 or more survey respondents are â€œveryâ€\\x9d or â€œfairlyâ€\\x9d satisfied with current neoadjuvant (67%), adjuvant (70%), and peri-operative (61%) treatment options as a whole.However, satisfaction varies by tumor and is highest among cancers with well-established therapies, such as breast cancer (87% satisfaction in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings) and melanoma (77% satisfaction in adjuvant). Regarding kidney and liver cancers, satisfaction is noticeably lower (less than 35% satisfaction with neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and peri-operative options), signaling the need for additional research.Providers responding to the BMS survey indicated they tend to use immunotherapy in earlier stages (either as approved therapies or in clinical trials), but typically not as often as other treatments. The respondents report more experience using chemotherapy (85%, 86%, and 73% for neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and peri-operative, respectively) than immunotherapy (48%, 65%, and 39%, respectively), likely reflecting that immunotherapy remains under investigation in a number of tumor types and only recently emerged as an approved option in others.The survey explored perceptions of immunotherapy and found many providers see the potential for a positive impact with immunotherapy in earlier stages of disease. They indicated seeing the highest potential for positive outcomes in melanoma (92% report positive potential impact in the adjuvant setting), lung cancer (89% in the neoadjuvant setting), and bladder or urothelial cancer (84% in the adjuvant setting).Whatâ€™s more, those surveyed believe the potential benefits of immunotherapy align with what currently drives treatment preferences in earlier settings. Choosing from a list of benefits, the said the most important potential benefits of immunotherapy as longer overall survival (64%), increased disease-free, event-free, or recurrence-free survival (57%), and maintenance of quality of life (54%).Finally, the respondents said the need for more data is a top barrier to the adoption of immunotherapy in earlier stages of cancer. From a list, surveyed participants selected the need for long-term and overall survival data as leading barriers to adoption of immunotherapy in earlier stages of cancer (53% and 50%, respectively), reinforcing the importance of ongoing research and follow-up analyses.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Global Genes, a global organization offering advocacy for rare disease patients and researchers, has launched its Patient Identification and Engagement for Rare CNS Disorders (PIE4CNS) initiative. The program is geared toward combatting gaps in diagnoses of rare central nervous system conditions, in addition to helping find and engage qualified patients.Craig Martin, CEO of Global Genes, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about the unique challenges and obstacles faced in rare CNS research, and how the PIE4CNS initiative stands to make a difference in the field.OSP: Could you please talk about the challenges a typical trial faces regarding patient ID and engagement?â€‹CM: One major underlying challenge is the difficulty and delay in diagnosis of rare neurological, or CNS, conditions. Although rare diseases collectively impact 1 in 10 people in the US and therefore could be considered â€œcommon,â€\\x9d there are more than 7,000 different known rare diseases (with some estimates as high as 9,000+), and each can manifest very differently.Doctors may never have seen a patient with one of these conditions. Patients may not have access to the kind of testing needed to identify the disease. The medical information a doctor may need to get to a diagnosis or understand the progression of a disease may be scattered across health systems and specialists.In addition, doctors are often reliant on parents or caregivers to observe symptoms, which are difficult to capture and share in ways that a clinician can easily use or interpret. And, if the condition is ultra-rare, there may only be a handful of patients in the world with that disease â€“ so how do you identify, reach and engage those patients in a trial?OSP: What are some of the solutions researchers have come up with to help tackle these obstacles?â€‹CM: There really arenâ€™t reliable solutions, yet, to effectively address these challenges. A critical obstacle is the lack of access to patient data, which (if it exists) often ends up siloed within a single research or medical institution, or EHR provider, or is walled off based on varied global policies or standards for data privacy.Patients and caregivers need better tools, access to testing, and the ability to share and assess data that may support a clear diagnosis and identify a patient for treatment or access to clinical trials. RARE-X is one initiative that has sprung up to address this challenge, with the idea that patients should be able to collect and contribute their data on common platforms for diagnostic or research purposes and to drive progress toward the development of effective treatments in their disease are.Our PIE4CNS initiative is designed to identify and prioritize challenges and related solutions we can work on together to improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of clinical trials.OSP: Similarly, what are the unique, or maybe more formidable, challenges that come up when the trial involves rare neuro conditions?â€‹CM: Recent estimates suggest nearly half of all rare diseases are neurological, and as many as 90 percent1 of all pediatric rare diseases have a CNS component to them. In addition to being rare and potentially hampered by a lack of access to screening tests and genomic sequencing, these CNS conditions come with a plethora of other unique challenges that stem from the lack of expertise to diagnose early and accurately; objectively observing and understanding the impacts of these conditions on developmental or other related milestones and symptoms; and difficulties and inequities in reaching, connecting and including underserved populations. The PIE4CNS initiative was established to address these unmet needs.OSP: Please tell us about PIE4CNSâ€”how did the idea for this unique initiative come together, and how did the stakeholders put it all together?â€‹CM: The PIE4CNS multi-stakeholder initiative was launched to address major gaps in the timely and comprehensive diagnosis of rare central neurological conditions, and related difficulties in finding and inclusively engaging patient populations in clinical research in gene therapy and other promising technologies. There are literally hundreds of gene therapies in development around the world, many for rare conditions, and yet if we are unable to identify and involve patients in trials, potentially promising therapies may not make it to patients.Since less than 5% of rare diseases currently have approved treatments, we need for every trial with the potential to benefit patients to have the best chance possible of succeeding.OSP: What are some of the short- and long-term goals of PIE4CNS, and how do your members plan on going about achieving them?â€‹CM: Our goal is to identify high-priority opportunities for impact on the most critical issues affecting inclusive, timely, and accurate diagnosis and identification of rare CNS patients, and their involvement in research and care. Our first step was to convene an expert panel representing patients, clinicians, researchers, and industry.Weâ€™re now issuing a survey to patients/caregivers and clinicians to get their sense of whatâ€™s most important and actionable. Then weâ€™ll bring together three workshops on pediatric and rare CNS conditions, and health equity across rare neurological disorders; after which weâ€™ll issue a set of top-issue action recommendations for us to take on as a community, informed by this process, and build a coalition to make it happen.OSP: As you point out, analysts estimate up to 90% of rare conditions have a CNS aspectâ€”could you please talk about some of the struggles patients dealing with such conditions face around diagnosis and treatment, and how things like genetic testing could help?â€‹CM: The average diagnostic odyssey for a rare disease patient can be about 5-7 years, on average. When you consider more than half of rare disease patients are children, and 1/3 of them will die by the age of five, the time spent waiting for a diagnosis can literally be a lifetime.In addition, while the family or patient is searching for answers, the CNS impacts can rapidly advance, with often devastating, painful, irreversible, or deadly implications. In some instances, the ability to identify and treat a disease early on can mean the difference between a child developing and living a relatively normal life, or missing key milestones most families take for granted, and thereby losing vital neuromuscular or cognitive functions, the ability to communicate, and more.We are now experiencing significant progress in gene therapy and other platform approaches targeting rare diseases, with many focused on devastating CNS conditions for both pediatric and adult populations. However, the clinical neurology community needs to have the systems and infrastructure in place to effectively diagnose, reach and engage as many of these patients as possible in clinical trials.Importantly, as we think about these issues and challenges, we also need to understand and more carefully consider the needs of underserved patients â€“ including from communities of color â€“ because they are often impacted differently by their experiences in the health system and underrepresented in clinical trial programs.OSP: Please tell us more about the workshops youâ€™ve got plannedâ€”to whom will you be targeting the events, what topics might be on the table, and what should attendees of these workshops expect?â€‹CM: As part of the initiative, three workshops will be held to explore unique and common challenges specific to rare pediatric and adult-onset CNS conditions, as well as from a health equity perspective. Based on the results of the workshops, the initiative will develop and issue a report and recommendations for action in 2022, which will be the basis for a second, broader phase of activities for the initiative.We will include patients/caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and drug developers in these workshops as they are the ones most familiar with the distinct challenges, from their perspective, that get in the way of patient diagnosis, identification, and involvement in clinical research.OSP: Is there anything youâ€™d like to add?â€‹CM: The most critical thing we need at this phase is for clinicians, and in particular neurologists who see rare disease patients, to add their insights, participate in workshops, and then engage their networks in the next phase of our work to take coordinated action in helping us to address these important issues. Any clinician who is interested can visit GlobalGenes.org/rare-neuro-patient-engagement for more information and to stay informed about the initiative.'},\n",

Please feel free to talk about the various factors, and how they have been valued.â€‹JC: The decisions are made using a cost-benefit analysis. However, to truly arrive at the right decision, costs are extended to the total cost of ownership (TCO), and the benefits are evaluated from an overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) perspective.While traditionally, the cost of the equipment influenced the decision almost completely, today a more mature decision-making format includes the TCO. This encompasses all costs incurred that are due to the machine which includes the initial investment in its purchase, utility consumption, the cost of downtime, sub-optimal functioning, and other more subtle costs such as training, overages, and wastages, and any upgrades required. Full TCO exposes the hidden costs of a decision, ensuring a more informed one can be made.Similarly, to fully comprehend the effectiveness of a machine the OEE considers the availability, its performance, and its quality. This ensures that along with the efficiency of the machine, the downtime and the wastages are encompassed in order to fully account for the effectiveness.OSP: What have been some of the issues or challenges with that conventional approach?â€‹JC: The traditional approach of considering the initial purchase price of the machine as its cost, did not factor in the potential hidden costs. This led to a strain on the operational efficiency and efficacy of the purchase decisions. Indeed, these costs can be hard to compute due to the complexity involved in gathering data from various sources.Computational errors also creep in due to biases of one cost over the other. The strongest challenge to these comes in the form of a lack of data, which can accurately predict the costs due to unplanned downtime or breakdowns, and efficiency losses due to error.OSP: How has the COVID-19 impacted manufacturing, priorities of operation leaders, etc.?â€‹JC: As a result of the pandemic, pharma manufacturing has been impacted. Primarily, this has been a loss of production time due to lockdowns and other measures imposed to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.Due to this loss, operations are more focused than ever to drive optimization â€“ with a real drive around efficiency enhancement measures. They are looking for ways to ramp up the productivity of existing and new equipment, to make up for the loss in productivity, but also as a result of the increased demand for life-saving medicine. Measures adopted for this include the use of OEM-approved parts, virtual discussions and analysis with experts, and opting for high-capacity, low-footprint machines.Almost as immediately as the Covid-19 pandemic struck, pharma companies rose to the challenge of developing and producing medicine that would save the millions of people affected by the illness, as well as preventing billions of others from contracting it. This has - in effect - increased the focus on reducing time to file and time to market of the newly developed drugs. Indeed, with the aid of well-managed data, thorough research analytics and optimized development mechanisms this has been made possible.Another effect that is being seen is the strain on the economy and consequently the financing of development and the production of pharma products. As a solution, agile and smart pharma manufacturers are turning towards more cost-effective and expertise-driven manufacturing solutions and OEMs from countries like India (known as â€˜the pharmacy of the worldâ€™).OSP: Could you tell us how digitalization has impacted pharma manufacturing? What are some of the new (or perhaps underutilized) manufacturing technologies and techniques that have emerged/increased since the pandemicâ€™s arrival?â€‹John Carey, VP of sales, ACG EngineeringJC: The most prominent use of digitalization has been centered around communication â€“ primarily relating to troubleshooting and offering remote support also.Part of this has been related to training, which is vital when it comes to enhancing the productivity of the equipment and ensuring its optimal use. Virtual training can be accessed from anywhere and can be held for multiple locations at the same time.Virtual reality (VR) and animation tools also enable us to better explore the internal workings of the equipment. The virtual environment has also given rise to a cross-pollination of great ideas and best practices across plants and customer locations, which has been hugely beneficial.Pharma manufacturers are not able to save a tremendous amount of time and money by conducting factory acceptance tests and formulation trials virtually has provided them pharma manufacturers access to OEMs and experts in all corners of the globe - truly unlocking the potential of collaboration across geographies and cultures.Going forward, further digitalization will yield higher control, improved optimization, balanced production, and efficient processes through data and analysis of trends.OSP: Now, please tell us about smart manufacturing, and how pharma leaders can implement such tech/practices intelligently.â€‹JC: Smart manufacturing is a technology-driven approach that utilizes internet-connected machinery to monitor the production process. The goal of smart manufacturing is to identify opportunities for automating operations and use data analytics to improve manufacturing performance. The three key steps to implementation of smart manufacturing include:Creating a digital mindsetIdentifying the uses cases and the roadmap aheadSelecting the right partner to support you on this journeyAt ACG, our recently launched ACG Smart Connected (ASC) product will bring a new era of condition monitoring and performance optimization of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment. Encompassing a wide variety of new service offerings, such as predictive analytics and guided maintenance by our subject matter experts, ASC will provide a whole new level of optimized pharma manufacturing.OSP: How can pharma operation leaders best work to ensure smart manufacturing, operations, and company culture are all in harmony?â€‹JC: By following the four-step plan, which includes: defining the vision, the metrics, implementation of systems, and training. To effectively implement smart manufacturing practices, pharma leaders will:Transform the core: digitize and integrate all their departments such as engineering and production.Focus on experiences and outcomes: create hyper-personalized value to differentiate and lead in the market.Re-architect the new ecosystem: assemble and refresh the right partners to drive innovation and new capabilities.Innovate new business models: invent new revenue streams for new sources of value.Build the workforce: source, enable, up-skill, and protect the next generation of talent.In summary, they will need to demonstrate a real commitment to smart manufacturing.OSP: Specifically, what about outdated pharma mindsets should be altered to bring about the more â€˜holisticâ€™ mindset you mention?â€‹JC: Our industry is quickly adapting to the reality of living in a digital world. With technologies including track-and-trace, PAT and SCADA controls having led the way for decades now, the industry is quickly becoming one with technologies in the Industrial IOT domain and it has risen to the challenge of adoption.Aligning with market demands and using big data and AI to unlock undiscovered business potential, pharma leaders are quickly leading the digital transformation on all fronts. Reliance on archaic business models and manufacturing patterns is being seen as an accelerator towards this transformation.The after-effects of the pandemic are motivating the industry in the direction of digitization, and with the adoption of better and more current techniques, the industry needs to continue the momentum to bring about the holistic mindset.OSP: What additional advice would you offer any pharma leaders looking to bring their ops and culture into the 21st century?â€‹JC: Pharma leaders looking to adopt the â€˜digital revolutionâ€™ and develop a more robust setup for the 21st century will need to:Embrace new digital strategies and business modelsInvest in technology and digitalizationUse data for greater online experienceThink about their teamsBuild the right capabilitiesFocus on the future'},\n",

Additionally, the firm has announced it is partnering with researchers from Mayo Clinic to codevelop and advance the platform.Aniket Singh Rajput, CEO and founder of Neuroglee Therapeutics, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about the companyâ€™s latest infusion of investment funds, its novel digital therapeutics solutions, and what the developments might mean for patients dealing with Alzheimerâ€™s and other cognitive impairments.OSP: Could you please tell us a bit about digital therapeutics and virtual care solutionsâ€”how has this field evolved in recent years, and can you share any advancements?â€‹ASR: Even before COVID-19, there was significant interest around digital therapeutics as providers and life sciences companies researched and discovered that such therapies are effective in helping patients with or with a companion drug across numerous conditions. This has been particularly true for complex, difficult-to-manage conditions such as mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimerâ€™s disease where few pharmacotherapies are available for the condition, leaving clinicians to manage symptoms in isolation by trial and error.Often digital therapeutics include a virtual care component to support efficacy such as remote monitoring, care management, and interventions, delivered by clinicians through video, text, or voice.The pandemic drastically accelerated research and development of both digital therapeutics and virtual care solutions focused on clinical decision support, as both can be delivered in the comfort of the patientâ€™s home incorporating the personal mobile technologies patients are already familiar with and use regularly. For our specialty, neurodegenerative diseases, there is growing evidence around how cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be delivered digitally, slows the progression of the disease.The challenge, though, is that not all cognitive-behavioral therapies work the same for every patient and there needs to be a very specific personalized and dynamic care path for an individual. Using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and novel biomarkers can support and accelerate optimal personalized therapy when supported by a virtual care team specialized in neurodegenerative disease.OSP: Could you please share a short description of Neuroglee Therapeutics, including who your team is, and any of the advancements mentioned in Q1 that your company has achieved?â€‹ASR: Neuroglee Therapeutics offers personalized prescription digital therapeutics that leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and novel digital biomarkers with the goal of slowing the progression of neurogenerative diseases, including mild cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Our digital therapeutic can be used with pharmacological therapy or as a standalone treatment, with a focus on slowing cognitive decline.The platform employs engaging gamification techniques and cognitive tasks on a smartphone or tablet so that patientsâ€™ clinicians can remotely monitor their cognitive function and intervene using personalized cognitive rehabilitation techniques. Neurogleeâ€™s machine-learning algorithms personalize each patient's therapy by automatically adjusting, or titrating, the therapeutic mobile-based activities based on several novel digital biomarkers tied to cognitive function, mood, and behavior.For example, adjustments will be made to the number and type of tasks and games that are offered, based on the speed of the patientâ€™s finger movements, time to complete games or tasks, and their facial expression identified through the device camera.The solution also incorporates reminiscence therapy, which uses images from the patientâ€™s past to evoke positive memories and emotions, which have been shown to improve cognitive functioning. The patientâ€™s family caregiver also has an app, where they can monitor the patientâ€™s adherence and even contribute to reminiscence therapy by uploading family photos and videos.These and other cognitive behavioral therapy techniques can reduce depression and anxiety that are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.We are launching our platform with a focus on mild cognitive impairment, but our product pipeline also includes digital therapies for Parkinsonâ€™s disease and stroke. All will be treated using similar digital therapeutic care paths on our personalized cognitive intervention platform that tailors treatment for the individual, who receives support from a specialized virtual care team.OSP: Please tell us about this funding round, how you anticipate Neuroglee will put the money to work, and what this investment signifies about your company/its capabilities.â€‹Aniket Singh Rajput, CEO and founder, Neuroglee TherapeuticsASR: We recently announced our $10m Series A funding round led by Openspace Ventures with participation by EDBI, the latter of which also founded successful digital health start-ups such as Biofourmis, Livongo, Aetion, and Hummingbird Bioscience. The funding will primarily help us further develop our first line of solutions for treating mild cognitive impairment related to difficult-to-treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, while also advancing the other digital therapeutics in our pipeline.At the same time, the funding will help us complete the necessary research, verifications, and documentation for earning a Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA, which we are currently working on.Another important initiative that this funding will help advance is Neuroglee Connect, which is the virtual specialty care service that we are developing with Mayo Clinic. Lastly, the funding will help with moving Neurogleeâ€™s headquarters from Singapore to Boston and enable us to build and scale our engineering, clinical operations, and commercial teams in one of the largest digital health hubs in the world.OSP: Could you please share a bit about the Mayo Clinic partnership, how you connected, and how this partnership will fuel the Neuroglee Connect development?â€‹Portals and app interfaces for Neuroglee Connect, a remote care solution for patients with mild cognitive impairmentASR: Neuroglee Connect is a novel clinical care program that will be based on Mayo Clinicâ€™s Healthy Action to Benefit Independence & Thinking (HABIT), a 10-day in-person program to provide patients and their families with state-of-the-art, evidence-based, lifestyle and behavioral treatments for MCI.Neuroglee Connect will combine the evidence-based HABIT program and Neurogleeâ€™s adaptive learning platform to create personalized, real-time responsiveness and interventions in managing patients in the comfort of their homes. Patients will be supported by round-the-clock health navigators and clinical care teams for near real-time assessment and interventions.Â\\xa0With care expanding outside of the hospital and into the home, this partnership is helping more patients access this program, not just limited to those who live near a Mayo Clinic service area. Our technology and virtual specialty care team make Neuroglee Connect eminently scalable, giving clinicians actionable data and patients access to world-class care, no matter where they are.OSP: Do you have anything to addâ€”about your company, DTx tech in general, progress in therapies for cognitive impairment, or anything else?â€‹ASR: An important aspect of Neurogleeâ€™s platform is that it is not just for patients and professional clinicians, but also for patientsâ€™ families, who are most often the caregivers in the home. A concerning statistic is that 76% of the caregivers for people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease report that their own health has worsened as they have cared for a family member. That is why Neuroglee has a separate caregiver module that helps them manage their family member with a neurodegenerative condition but also offers education, support, and tools for identifying and overcoming the stress, anxiety, and other symptoms that can affect caregivers.\"},\n",

The new indication for the treatment is designed for add-on maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adult patients 18 years of age and older that have not experienced an adequate response to nasal corticosteroids.According to GSK, CRSwNP is found in up to 4% of the US population, or more than 5m people. Chronic symptoms can include nasal obstruction, loss of smell, facial pressure, and nasal discharge.GSK reports that mepolizumab is the first anti-IL-5 biologic to be approved for adult patients with CRSwNP in the US. Outsourcing-Pharma talked about the drugâ€™s development and approval with US mepolizumab lead Jared Silver, who said its approval offers hope to chronic CRSwNP patients that have been suffering from symptoms.â€œThere really have been limited options, and there tend to be less effective therapeutic options for more severe diseaseâ€‹,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe standard of care can include saline rinses, sometimes steroid sprays; others go on to oral steroids, which can have more toxicity and adverse events. More severe patients go on to require surgery, which usually entails endoscopically removing diseased tissueâ€‹.â€\\x9dTonya Windersâ€”CEO and president of the Allergy and Asthma Network (AAN) and president of Global Allergy and Airways Patient Platformâ€”agreed that Nucalaâ€™s approval offers a welcome expansion to the limited options for CRSwNP treatment.â€œPatients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps experience unpleasant symptoms across a range of severitiesâ€‹,â€\\x9d she said. â€œWe welcome the news that mepolizumab will now offer appropriate patients and healthcare providers a novel treatment option and alternative to surgeryâ€‹.â€\\x9dSilver added that the therapeutic benefits of mepolizumab fall in four ways:reducing symptoms and polyp burdenelevating quality of lifeavoiding the need for surgeryeliminating exposure to potentially harmful steroids.The dosage is 100mg subcutaneously injected once a month. Patients have the option of receiving the injection from their physician at their office, or at home with an auto-injector.The FDAâ€™s approval of mepolizumab to treat CRSwNP is based on data from the SYNAPSE study, which examined the drugâ€™s effect compared to that of a placebo in more than 400 patients with the condition. According to GSK, mepolizumab achieved significant improvement in reducing the size of nasal polyps and nasal obstruction; all study participants received standard care, had previously undergone surgery (some more than three surgeries), and had been diagnosed as being in need of additional surgery due to symptom severity and polyp size.Mepolizumab is also approved for use for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma 6 years and older. The treatment also was the first biologic indicated for adults with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and the first biologic to be approved for patients aged 12 years and older with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).Â\\xa0'},\n",

For instance, consideration of local technology standards and connectivity can influence which web and/or mobile application to be deployed. Further, understanding connectivity support and local infrastructure may require more provisioning of devices, or ensuring effective off-line or backup features.Â\\xa0It is vital to also consider the patient and site burden of the solutions being implemented and assess the ease of their usage within the local environment, particularly if patients reside in remote locations from any site or core infrastructure. Of course, all patient-facing applications need to be deployed in local languages. Often, we need to support five or more languages within a single country so planning effectively for this is critical.OSP: Could you please share an example of how failure to anticipate such differences can lead to problems in trial execution?â€‹Alison Holland, head of decentralized clinical trials, MedableAH: When deploying decentralized study solutions, Medable always considers the local socio-economic environments of the patients themselves â€“ especially if provisioning devices and sensors â€“ and remaining mindful of local standards. Smartphone devices that may be ubiquitous in some countries, may be seen as irresistibly attractive and an unreasonable inducement for study entry if a different device that can complete the same functions would be more aligned to what is common in that geography.Understanding all these factors, and the logistics, and provisioning workflows are key to ensuring we are supporting all patients consistently around the world and collecting evaluable and compliant data.OSP: Is it ever possible to design a one-size-fits-all DCTâ€”or to even come close?â€‹AH: At Medable, we believe itâ€™s important to design and deploy DCT solutions that offer consistent choices to sites and patients about how they can engage within the study, offering flexibility where a protocol can safely accommodate, for some or all activities, to be conducted in non-traditional bricks and mortar settings. With this in mind, we all have different views on what would be an attractive choice and therefore, a one-size-fits-all model is not fit for purpose.Being able to accommodate different workflows within a single study is key, for example, and being able to utilize different consenting execution workflows according to age, local legal standards, etc. means that several workflows need to be available within a single study to maintain compliance and quality.OSP: Are there ways DCT teams can partner with local researchers, healthcare providers or other resources to help improve the access and inclusivity of their trials, to ensure maximum patient engagement/retention, and minimal snags?â€‹AH: Absolutely! DCTs enable us to make studies much more visible to a far broader audience, bringing the study into the community and into the home and providing more convenience and consumer-style choice to collect high-quality, robust, and quantifiable data from participants from a location of their choice.For example, collecting real-time patient diaries, together with wearable sensor data for vital signs measurement allows many patients to remain out of the traditional site but under the care of their clinical study team for symptoms and health monitoring. In addition, trials augmented by local pharmacies and community clinics can further improve trial access, enrollment, and retention.By enabling local pharmacies to become access points or supplemental investigator sites, for DCTs, 90% of Americans suddenly become within a five-minute drive of a clinical trial. Not only does this provide greater convenience for patients, but it also helps nurture greater trust because patients are getting care from the people they know and see around town.Jena Daniels, vice president of patient successJD: To define a more human-centered approach to research and better embed the patient and caregiver voices across the clinical development landscape, Medable established its Patient Success team. Our network of diverse patients, advocates, and caregivers provides their candid perspectives on every feature and functionality of the Medable platform.We incorporate their valuable feedback; their unique backgrounds, experiences, and direct understanding of patient preferences make them an invaluable resource to those intent on removing patient-facing barriers to participation in clinical research. When properly implemented, the power of the patientsâ€™ and caregiversâ€™ lived experiences can reduce protocol deviations, minimize trial dropout, and improve patient engagement.Through these kinds of engagements, we may be able to truly disrupt the clinical trial model and redefine what it means to be human-centeredâ€¦rather, human-invested.OSP: Does a CRO need to have its own international presence for international trials to succeed?â€‹AH: Medable partners with CROs and sponsors to enable clinical trials all around the world. In fact, Medableâ€™s software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform has been deployed in more than 60 countries via more than 150 decentralized and hybrid clinical trials to achieve unprecedented results â€“ including 3X faster enrollment, 90% retention rates, and 50% cost reductions.Regardless of location, itâ€™s very important to have a clear and informed perspective of standards and practices locally and the regulatory and data localization requirements for compliance. As such, we appreciate working with CROs that have a local presence and, for some studies, this is critical for compliance and other GCP-required processes but not mandatory for all studies. We approach each study individually, on a trial-by-trial basis.OSP: What other words of wisdom do you have?â€‹AH: The world is rapidly changing and evolving as we adapt to our ongoing pandemic â€˜new normalâ€™ making it more important than ever to enhance the quality of clinical trials, the speed to drug decision-making, and the accessibility and inclusivity of clinical research to patients around the world.Designing and deploying DCT solutions focused on patient needs and preferences, optimizing and amplifying their connectivity with clinical care, and collecting real-time data will transform clinical trials in ways weâ€™ve never seen before.

In fact, Medableâ€™s software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform has been deployed in more than 60 countries via more than 150 decentralized and hybrid clinical trials to achieve unprecedented results â€“ including 3X faster enrollment, 90% retention rates, and 50% cost reductions.Regardless of location, itâ€™s very important to have a clear and informed perspective of standards and practices locally and the regulatory and data localization requirements for compliance. As such, we appreciate working with CROs that have a local presence and, for some studies, this is critical for compliance and other GCP-required processes but not mandatory for all studies. We approach each study individually, on a trial-by-trial basis.OSP: What other words of wisdom do you have?â€‹AH: The world is rapidly changing and evolving as we adapt to our ongoing pandemic â€˜new normalâ€™ making it more important than ever to enhance the quality of clinical trials, the speed to drug decision-making, and the accessibility and inclusivity of clinical research to patients around the world.Designing and deploying DCT solutions focused on patient needs and preferences, optimizing and amplifying their connectivity with clinical care, and collecting real-time data will transform clinical trials in ways weâ€™ve never seen before. Specifically, we will begin to generate richer insights from machine learning and advanced data analytics that will inform optimal disease and therapeutic management and help the industry create effective, breakthrough treatments of the future.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Outsourcing-Pharma spoke with Mark Tomlinson, senior director of technology operations with contract research organization (CRO) Cmed, about what a trial team needs before planning to launch decentralized studies, and what technology tools can help make the transition easier.OSP: Could you please share your thoughts on all the considerations trial teams have to weigh when planning to use decentralized features in a study?â€‹MT: When planning to use DCTs, teams need to first evaluate their existing tools and vendors in relation to this new paradigm of patient centricity. Internal tools need to have a capacity to support more virtual and remote activities, and any vendors need to be able to demonstrate experience of supporting decentralized study processes and expectations, with appropriate software and processes.With normal studies, the range of data sources is manageable and easily controlled through current processes. However, with decentralized, there are more data types, more volume, and most, if not all, would be eSource data e.g., DDC, ePRO, eCOA, central labs, both structured and unstructured, so strong data providence is vital. The DCT tools need to include this providence as an inherent aspect of its architecture, to ease set-up but also avoid even more manual reconciliation, and clinical management during the study, than normal.There are a lot of solutions offered by the industry, but many are a collection of loosely linked point solutions, often needing parallel build processes for each solution. Although these can collect and share the data, they are fundamentally inefficient and create additional work for study teams, especially with regards to protocol updates. Small changes in one area can have significant knock-on effects across other areas, all of which need high levels of awareness, control, and management.To run DCTs, teams ideally need a singular platform that encompasses the collection, review, management, analysis, and visualization of the trial data, however disparate that may be, utilizing a single build process. This ensures consistency across the data sources, inherent providence as well as efficient management of any protocol changes. This single platform needs to offer the various involved teams, a holistic and real-time view of all the data in that trial, with visibility of trends across patients, sites, and possibly trials.With this new trial paradigm and associated tooling come new opportunities for efficiency and cost savings. Processes must be carefully updated, and teams aligned to make the most of what the technology can offer, to minimize resourcing. Keeping existing processes whilst switching out the technology is not sufficient and may even be detrimental to the trial.Â\\xa0OSP: What kinds of technological tools might come into play? Feel free to talk about wearables, devices home-health nurses might use to take vitals, patient-facing apps, etc.â€‹MT: DCTs inherently require more mobile solutions and as such can create multiple interfaces with the subject. Increasing use of telephone or video visits, use of wearable technologies, mobile apps on the subjectâ€™s phone, and even home delivery of an investigational product is now possible. Together these shift the balance towards the patient, transforming their experience. A trial that fits around the subjectâ€™s life - decreased site visits for instance - can increase patient commitment, increase data quality, trial compliance as well as increase patient retention overall.New technologies such as wearables would all need to be qualified for capture of clinical-grade endpoints, whilst providing a modern, easy-to-use, intuitive user interface for the subject. Where these patient-facing tools are not sufficient on their own, such as clinician-led assessments, tooling needs to offer a way to capture data efficiently and directly in the subjectâ€™s home.With increasing subject data, a key area of consideration would be to ensure data privacy is appropriately managed, especially where trials are multinational - including the associated user management and security controls.OSP: Can you share some of the challenges typically associated with technology in DCTs and things sites/sponsors might miss the mark on?â€‹MT: A key challenge will be providing tools that the average man in the street wants to use. Most clinical trial systems used now are built on older foundations that are designed for â€˜trainedâ€™ users in a fixed context.However, the digital/virtual world of today is anything but a fixed context and I see a huge gap between the flexibility and user compatibility of consumer devices and the current clinical systems â€“ moving to DCTs needs a system with the same level of user-friendliness and intuitive operation that weâ€™ve all come to expect from our mobile apps. Ease of use is critical to ensure high-quality data, patient retention, and satisfaction.Looking at this from another angle, DCTs will include multiple data sources, as well as unstructured data so, a challenge will be updating existing technology to adequately support the associated processes, such as aggregation of the disparate data, and structural processing of unstructured data before assimilation. On top of this, each data source will necessitate additional effort and time.Â\\xa0Once the study is live, how the data will be monitored, the quality maintained, and the patients supported needs to be decided. Assuming the existing processes will all translate to the new range of data sources can create frustration and increase the teamâ€™s workload, without any additional value. Sponsors need to consider that what was needed to manage transcribed data, is different from that needed for site entered DDC and could be different again with direct from patient data.To truly enable DCTs, we need new thinking; an obvious area is the automation of data aggregation to reduce the effort needed and decrease lag time between data capture and analysis whilst increasing quality. The tech needs to be flexible to accommodate new input sources, whilst maintaining an ability to provide immediacy of data visualization across all the data, patients, sites, and even across the trial. In combination with conduct activities, this new world needs multi-modal data monitoring as well as performance feedback to further hone the new processes.Ultimately, increasing data quality, improving patient safety, facilitating rapid data aggregation, and the subsequent improvement in decision making is what weâ€™ve all been looking for.OSP: Could you tell us about Encapsiaâ€”what it is, how it works, and what challenges associated with DCTs it seeks to address?â€‹MT: Encapsia is simply the most innovative, powerful, and holistic data capture platform available. It brings a complete solution to collect and manage trial data, with EDC, eSource, and home visit data capture options, supported by a host of other modalities to manage medical coding, data review, third-party data as well as self-service study extracts and archiving.Our fully featured API allows us two-way integrations with other systems allowing immediate aggregation and visualization, streamlining site and review team interactions. This is particularly relevant to DCTs where there can be a range of data sources, often including unstructured data.Â\\xa0Encapsia recognizes the need to access your data on your own terms with no barriers, so all data is accessible via self-service download or direct connection so client teams can get what they want, when they want it, 24/7.As all the data in Encapsia is available live, it empowers faster, better-informed decisions throughout the trial. For trial teams, thereâ€™s no downtime for trial updates: our industry-leading point-of-entry checks ensure cleaner data on entry, enhancing speed and cost-savings.Encapsia operates in a live, cloud-hosted repository purposely built to leapfrog the current legacy systems and their limitations - supporting where trials are going, not where they were yesterday. Encapsia enables teams to interact with live, up-to-the-minute data, wherever they are, increasing efficiency, reducing the burdens on the site and patient whilst improving the quality of investigator-patient relationships. Flexibility is built-in; itâ€™s future-proof out the box.Â\\xa0OSP: Please tell us about the Home Visit app, and how it works.â€‹MT: Encapsia Home Visit lets you conduct a trial visit at the patientâ€™s home, instead of getting the patient to arrange travel to the site. Study nurses capture data as eSource directly on an iPad, with instant validation of the entered data, significantly increasing data quality.Like the iPad, itâ€™s fully mobile and works seamlessly on and offline, connecting to known wi-fi and registering all data with the server automatically, with multimedia options such as image capture or dictated notes. Home Visit also supports a â€˜patient modeâ€™ where the patient can enter their own data, for instance, a quality-of-life assessment.Encapsia Home Visit can hold any number of studies and sites, so each nurse needs only one iPad to access all their active studies.OSP: Because not every patient is tech-savvy, patient-facing technology tools can be challenging to design and implement. Can you share some strategies, and things to consider when using such elements in a DCT?â€‹MT: Tools need to be easy to use for anyone - whether eight or 80. There are significant differences between a UI for eight-year-olds as for 80-year-olds - both in terms of physicality, visual acuity, and recognition abilities, to name but a few.DCT needs to be flexible enough to accommodate the differences in subject populations and ensure quality data in all cases. We need transformative tools that are intuitive and consumer-friendly with a clean and clear user interface.Technology choices must support the appropriate engagement of the patient, whilst also supporting the needs and perspectives of the clinical, review, and analytic teams that use that collected data. Any new digital technologies must incorporate seamlessly into the team workflows to avoid too much disruption in the transition from where we are today into this new world.OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹MT: DCTs come in so many different variations, itâ€™s vital for sponsors to change the mindset from â€œhow trials can be made to fit the tools we haveâ€\\x9dâ€‹, to one where â€œwe need to find the tools that fit our trialâ€\\x9d.â€‹ The standard technology used pre-pandemic is no longer fit for purpose, the industry must embrace agile, nimble technologies built specifically to support the virtual and decentralized.To do data differently, change must be embraced, using partners who can provide that revolutionary technology as well as technical consultancy, expertise to support that shared vision.Right now, itâ€™s probably riskier to stay fixed to the old way of doing things than move onto new options provided by new technology. Are youâ€‹ ready to step forward? Itâ€™s time to transform your trial today.'},\n",

They may have added some decentralized components to traditional trials or even in a few instances and conditions undertaken trials that were largely decentralized.However, dipping into this approach was largely experimental. With established procedures providing a level of comfort and familiarity â€“ and regulatory acceptance â€“ there was no sense of urgency in making decentralized components more mainstream.OSP: Then, what about after the pandemic started?â€‹KV: The pandemic created huge challenges for conducting traditional clinical trials, and with the urgency surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, it highlighted the need for and accelerated the move to decentralized trials. The industry pivoted very quickly to adopt new approaches, such as decentralized clinical trial methods, to keep clinical research going in these unprecedented times.According to research conducted by Oracle and Informa in 2020, 76% of clinical trial teams say they have sped up the use of decentralized trials methods during the pandemic. Sponsors took varying approaches to implementing these new models but some of the most common steps taken by respondents to our survey were the adoption of patient-facing technologies or alternatives (64%) and protocol redesign (63%), followed by the adoption of investigator-facing technologies or alternatives (53%).To illustrate this, weâ€™ve seen sponsors employ more and more technology for remote dataÂ\\xa0collection, and adopt new technology platforms to design and manage decentralized trials, while also employing advanced techniques to analyze all the resulting data.OSP: Could you please share some of the barriers sites and sponsors typically encounter whenÂ\\xa0looking to increase DCT adoption in their operations?â€‹KV: Perhaps the biggest barrier to decentralized trials has been the status quo mindset. With established procedures providing a level of comfort, familiarity, and regulatory acceptance â€”there was no real sense of urgency to make decentralized trials more mainstream prior to the pandemic. Another challenge overall has been the reluctance by the industry to incorporate new approaches and innovations or modify operational practices. But we are slowly seeing a shift.From a technological standpoint, the increase of patient-facing technology (i.e. electronic informed consent, known as eConsent, electronic patient-reported outcomeâ€”eProâ€”and wearables) has made decentralized trials a real option for sponsors and CROs over the past couple of years. It also enables sponsors and investigators to have a richer and more complete picture of patients than is possible in a traditional clinical trial.However, the amount of data generated in trials today is far more information than humans can process, and it is also much more complex. In our research respondents cited ensuring data reliability and quality (50%) and data collection (45%) as key barriers to implementing decentralized models.Luckily, great strides in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning have been applied to automate many data-heavy processes to lessen the pressure. AI and machine learning have two massive advantages â€“ they can process data faster and they can identify patterns and trends that humans canâ€™t see. This will ideally lead to a more accurate and detailed view of safety and how patients are responding in trials â€“ which can lead to faster time to market and better treatments.OSP: Could you please share some insight as to what types of changes in mindset need to happen in order to make the change to greater DCT adoption possible? Do these challenges related to changing over to DCT look different to executives in the corner office than they would to trial admins, and to CRA-level staff?â€‹KV: The pandemic forced the entire life sciences industry â€“ which has been notoriously slow to innovate â€“ to take a hard look and determine how to break the barriers that were standing in the way of innovation.Â\\xa0In order to make this happen, everyone â€“ from chief executives to chief science officers and chief medical officers within all organizations involved -- had to adjust their mindset. The pandemic provided a catalyst for new ways of working. It moved everyone â€” sponsors, sites, and regulators â€” to embrace, use, test, and implement many new ideas, approaches, and technology in clinical trials.Watching the industry come together to keep the vaccine clinical research moving has been one of the high points of the last 18 months. There has been tremendous support to keep this forward momentum and not fall back into â€œthe old waysâ€\\x9d of conducting clinical trials when the pandemic is over.The duration of the pandemic has been long and many of the initial growing pains have been surpassed. There remains a lot of optimism for change.OSP: What type of investmentâ€”in new technology, training, etc.â€”should an organization expect when increasing DCT adoption?â€‹Katherine Vandebelt, global VP of clinical innovation, Oracle Health SciencesKV: One of the most critical elements of a decentralized trial is a unified eClinical platform that can maintain a single data set that feeds a variety of functions. In such an environment, studies are only built once, data is only entered one time, and everything is available in one place. Staff no longer need to waste time entering data into multiple systems, which not only reduces the risk of human error but frees them to focus on more important work.A unified platform, like Oracle Health Sciences Clinical One, is capable of harmonizing the vast volume of data collected from disparate sources such as patient-worn sensors. In our research with Informa, half of the respondents reported that effectively tracking all that data is one of their biggest concerns with decentralized trials. A unified platform brings data together into a coherent view and across the different functions of the trial â€“ again, streamlining operations and enabling staff to focus on high-value tasks.For example, with Clinical One, data collection activity happens in the same environment as randomization and trial supply management activity, so sites can randomize, dispense therapies, and collect patient data in one place, which makes their job a lot easier.Sponsors must also seek out new data sources like mHealth devices that collect data from patients remotely, often automatically. These types of patient-worn sensors are available to measure everything from heart rate, blood glucose levels, electrical activity in the brain, activity level, and sleep.Our study found nearly two-thirds of those surveyed have implemented remote data collection in their trials â€“ with the bulk coming from patient apps, ePRO, and wearable devices. More than half the respondents reported they use, or will introduce, wearable devices within 18 months.OSP: What regulatory considerations should trial teams be aware of regarding DCTs?â€‹KV: The willingness of regulators to be flexible in the face of the pandemic enabled study teams to adopt many new technologies and obtain approvals. As the situation changed quickly, regulators also moved with speed to issue guidance to enable sponsors to introduce new approaches and protocols for trials.A clear example of this is the free FDA MyStudies appâ€‹ for investigators to obtain informed consent securely from patients for eligible clinical trials when face-to-face contact is not possible or practical due to COVID-19 control measures. This pivot enabled sponsors to conduct clinical trials in a safe manner, and at an accelerated pace to develop the COVID-19 vaccines.Yet, for all the effort and flexibility that was demonstrated, half the respondents to our survey still feel that â€œregulatory issues are holding them backâ€\\x9d from developing trials that have more virtual elements.At the same time, the pandemic has yielded some insights on how to create better regulations around decentralized trials, so a deliberate effort to create new or revised regulations covering decentralized methods may result in a better long-term direction. In addition, as the industry itself develops more data around decentralized trials and can present that to regulators, it will demonstrate that regulations can be revised to accommodate these new approaches.OSP: How can companies like Oracle help study professionals make the transition from onsite to DCT more effective and seamless?â€‹KV: Oracle has long been one of the worldâ€™s leading suppliers of clinical trial systems. Oracle Health Sciences Clinical One supports the move to the cloud and the shift to decentralized trials. Clinical trials require a single source of truth for data that is available to data managers, statisticians, medical monitors, and regulatory authorities.In the past, sponsors and CROs have used point solutions designed to improve specific processes in clinical trials, such as data capture, drug randomization, and supplies management. But these systems werenâ€™t built to work together, so a lot of process redundancy and data quality issues have been introduced.Clinical One is not point solutions stitched together but rather provides a unified workflow with capabilities such as a single study build, self-service control, event-based data collection, and a single source of truth. A major component of Clinical One is the ability to support data collection from anywhere, which allows users to configure and monitor external data collection from any source â€” forms, wearable sensors, patient apps, electronic health records (EHR), labs. These expanded data give sites and study teams optionality and a more complete picture of the patientâ€™s experience, and ultimately, more reliable safety and efficacy information of the investigative therapy.OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹KV: Thereâ€™s no denying we have entered a new era in the life sciences industry. COVID-19 put enormous pressure on the entire healthcare system and organizations running clinical trials, and at the same time, provided the impetus for moving at least some aspects of decentralized trials out of pilots and into the mainstream. The experience has shown the benefits of the approach, and few sponsors or CROs are considering turning back as they may not be as well equipped to adapt to risk.Modernization of ICH E8, General Considerations for Clinical Trials, linked with E6, Good Clinical Practice, guidelines will soon be here.Â\\xa0 They will support the agility and adaptability we need to reach the levels of study design, management, and conduct closest to the data and trial participants. Many have the desire and passion to take their experiences into flexible, reliable, and accountable practices and conduct more effective trials.Â\\xa0With the many questions the pandemic has raised, it has also brought to the mainstream an increased awareness around clinical trials and how vital they are to bringing treatments to patients in need. In the end, the patients are what is most important.Â\\xa0'},\n",

              "  'D': \"Technology is key in launching and operating decentralized clinical trials, but people also are an important part of the equation. With virtual and hybrid studies on the rise, the number of mobile research nurses involved in facilitating these trials also is climbing.Outsourcing-Pharma recently spoke to Illingworth Research Group's senior recruitment manager Alison Armstrong about exactly what a mobile research nurse does, what it takes to be one, and how to recruit qualified candidates among this highly specialized pool of professionals.OSP: Could you please explain in a nutshell what a mobile research nurse is and does?â€‹AA: Absolutely! To put it simply, a mobile research nurse takes the clinical trial visit to the patient, wherever that patient is â€” the patientâ€™s home, school, or workplace.These specialist nurses conduct any part of the trial that does not rely on hospital-only equipment. They do physical exams, take blood samples, collect vital signs, give infusions, and, of course, report the collected data back to the site, sponsor, or contract research organization (CRO). For patients, this arrangement offers tremendous advantages because they donâ€™t have to travel.Patients who work or are in school have less time away; patients who are homebound donâ€™t have to make complex travel arrangements; overall, lives are less disrupted.OSP: How is the job description of a mobile research nurse different than that of a conventional home-health nurse?â€‹AA: The core difference between a mobile research nurse and a conventional home health nurse is their degree of experience within the research industry. Because they are exclusively dedicated to supporting clinical trials, mobile research nurses are all trained in Good Clinical Practice and other aspects of the clinical trial environment.Conversely, a conventional home-health nurse would not be required to have an awareness of serious adverse event (SAE) and adverse event (AE) reporting, for example â€” knowledge that is crucial to the proper conduct of a research trial. A mobile research nurse is also trained in the use of specialized equipment that a traditional home-health nurse would have no reason to use.OSP: What specialized training is required for such staff? What training and coursework are available?â€‹AA: While people applying to be a mobile research nurse do not necessarily need any previous clinical trial experience, they do need a degree as a registered nurse (RN) and certification from the state where they are practicing. Beyond that, all mobile research nurses must be trained in Good Clinical Practice; individual companies may offer additional training.For instance, all Illingworth Research Group nurses work to a global set of standard operating procedures to ensure consistency for our sponsors conducting trials across the world. We also provide specific training in topics including advanced life-support, blood clinical practice, and handling dangerous goods, as well as specific education in the conduct of clinical trials.Then a mentor works directly with the nurse through their first several visits. In general, the entire training process takes two to three weeks.OSP: How do they obtain the necessary credentials to operate the specialized equipment required of them on their home visits?â€‹AA: Research nurse project managers, who are themselves nurses, work with the site and study sponsor to learn exactly what equipment will be used for the study, then create a training program and use it to train all the mobile research nurses involved with the study. At Illingworth Research Group, most of our equipment training is conducted virtually over video call by the Research Nurse Project Manager, so fortunately COVID-19 has not affected it at all. All the necessary equipment is sent directly to the nurse, and the virtual training sessions give them an opportunity to ask any questions.Of course, if the equipment is more specialized and complex the nurse will be asked to go on-site to complete training. So, for instance, a centrifuge, which is obviously just a blood spinning machine, is quite simple to use and can be easily learned over video; a spirometry device may require a trip to the site.Alison Armstrong, senior recruitment manager, Illingworth Research GroupAA: The pandemic has created a massive influx in companies wanting our services, since, obviously, vulnerable patients havenâ€™t wanted to leave their homes, while sponsors need their studies to continue. At the midpoint of this year, we have already achieved 80% of our 2020 results. That, in turn, has created enormous challenges in finding the most highly trained nurses, as many nurses headed back to hospitals to support increased caseloads there. However, we equally have seen nurses wanting to offer support any way they could, so we have been able to continue supporting our clients.Of course, there have been other challenges, starting with the vast pressure to ensure that research nurses have regular testing and are kept away from any COVID-positive sites. At the beginning there were also challenges in accessing the required personal protection equipment (PPE), and in simply being able to travel; some nurses reported 14-hour round trips to see their patients, with no available public transport or services stations. Thatâ€™s dedication.But back to the question about demand: It continues to grow. As the pandemic has progressed, patients have come to expect that mobile research nurses will be available to them. That level of convenience is becoming increasingly important to successful recruitment and retention.In tandem, both sponsors and patients have a growing interest in decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which rely heavily on localized data collection â€” whether through mHealth devices, local clinics, or mobile research nurses. These two drivers mean the demand for mobile research nursing will only continue to grow.OSP: Do such personnel work directly for the CROs, are they contracted out, or is it a mixture?â€‹AA: Mobile research nurses work directly for a company, such as Illingworth Research Group, and are then assigned to each individual study; the mobile nursing firm is contracted by the biotech or pharma company or by the CRO running the study. This arrangement enables the mobile nursing firm to manage resources, safety systems, and procedures for the research nurses.Often the nurses are hired on a flexible, contract basis; this gives the nurse ownership of their schedule, and the ability to determine how much work they want to do and when. At Illingworth Research Group we also have full-time equivalents in certain countries, including the US, the UK, and Spain. Because these nurses are fully committed to us, they can travel as necessary, covering visits and supporting our clients.OSP: If someone is interested in engaging the services of a mobile nursing firm, what should they look for in such a company, to ensure theyâ€™re qualified and capable of providing the level of service necessary?â€‹AA: Generally speaking, it is the sponsor or CRO who hires a mobile nursing firm â€” but anyone hiring a mobile nursing firm should ask for a presentation covering what the firm can provide to the site, what services are covered, and what is not covered in the contract. Specifically, they should ask:How will working with the firm reduce the burden on the site and/or sponsor?What is the benefit both to the site and/or sponsor and to the patients in a study?What kind of oversight exists for Principal Investigator (PI) and registration of Letter of Assurance (LOA)?Are pre-engagement checks done on nurses? Are the nurses insured?How does the firm troubleshoot? Can they guarantee that a contact will be readily available?Mobile nurses can help expand the pool of patients in a trial, reduce stress on participants, and minimize the chance of dropouts. They also free site investigators from smaller visit activities, such as blood draws, and allow them to pursue more complicated, higher-value services. They can clearly be a tremendous boon to a study, handsomely repaying any vetting process.\"},\n",

              "  'D': 'The COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench into the work for most clinical research operations, with decentralized trial technology offering hope for their research to continue. Ryan Jones, CEO of clinical trial tech company Florence, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about how the virus rocked the industry, and the crucial role decentralized research likely will continue to play.OSP: Could you please provide a â€˜nutshellâ€™ description of Florence?â€‹RJ: Florence solves a $20b [USD] clinical research access problem that no one is talking about: pharma trial sponsors only connect with their clinical trial sites with people, paper, and airplanes. This physical infrastructure impedes the remote work thatâ€™s now commonplace and slows the pace of cures.We solve this problem through softwareâ€” tools like eRegulatory, eConsent, eTMF, and eSourceâ€”built for trial sites first. Together, these applications form a digital research network connecting 10,000 sites allowing sponsors to go remote, skip the traditional monitoring visit and get an always-on connection to their studies.OSP: When we first met in 2020 at SCOPE, COVID-19 was a blip on the radar to most of the world. Could you think back and share what you remember about those early conversations about how the virus and pandemic were impacting R&D?â€‹RJ: Because sites and sponsors were connected only with people, paper, and airplanes, everything ground to a halt in March. Major CROs were reporting that 70% of their sites were inaccessible.Distressingly, this meant patients depending on studies for life-saving therapies were unable to continue their treatment schedules and were in real danger. Emerging studies never left the gate.Then, we saw a positive shift in early summer. Sponsors and CROs began using electronic tools to access sites and patients, and frozen new studies were replaced with COVID-specific protocols, so the volume of research (as reported by CT.gov) actually increased over that period.OSP: Specifically, what were your initial conversations with clients and colleagues alike bout strategies for shifting onsite research to DCTs?â€‹RJ: DCTs encompass a spectrum. They can be about remote connectivity to the patient through in-home or device-based trials. But they also can be about decentralizing the trial site itself, through enabling research at research-naÃ¯ve clinics or allowing remote work at established professional sites.We saw some shift to direct-to-patient, but most of the shift we saw was focused on transforming and mobilizing traditional sitesâ€”after all, sites were in use up to the minute before the pandemic.As a consequence, the heart of the DCT discussion then was less about bringing the trial directly to the patient, and more about empowering remote work at the siteâ€”empowering clinicians and staff to work remotely, and empowering sponsor monitors and project managers to work remotely. One of our site customers, Vanderbilt Medical Center, was able to move all its research staff to remote trial work in less than a week.OSP: How can trial tech like Florenceâ€™s solutions facilitate and accelerate the transition from brick-and-mortar sites to remote?â€‹Ryan Jones, CEO, FlorenceRJ: We help our brick-and-mortar site users with three types of transitions:Remote work transitions: This turned out to be a huge deal in the wake of the pandemic. In 2019, all data, content, and records were tied to the physical clinic location, preventing research teams from working from home at all. Our tools make research work location agnostic.Site federation transitions: This is where an experienced central site can support and enrollment at federated sites in a larger geographic areaâ€”provided they are connected with the right technology. This allows much faster and more diverse patient enrollment by removing brick-and-mortar academic centers as the only option for many studies. This is possible with our site tools that automate the creation and sharing of both regulatory and patient data.Direct-to-Patient Transitions: This is where patients can self-enroll in trials and self-report where they are through mobile apps that provide research tools like eConsent and ePro. This transition requires both the above transitionsâ€”as the need for research team oversight, remotely from home, persists, as does the need for local federated clinics to support certain key phases of the study.OSP: While Delta and other variants are preventing the research industry and the rest of the world from being â€œpost-COVIDâ€\\x9d we are at a point where weâ€™ve learned a great deal about COVIDâ€™s impact and can at least envision life after the virus. Could you please share your thoughts about what the study landscape might look like in a post-COVID universe? Will we ever see clinical research become totally siteless?â€‹RJ: The biggest change weâ€™ll see in the research landscape as a result of COVID is the continued shift in technology use. Earlier this year, we released survey results from our State of Clinical Trial Technology Industry Report, uncovering that 47% of sites and 36% of sponsors indicated they increased their technology budgets to reduce disruptions from the pandemic. The data confirmed what we hear from the 10,0000 sites and hundreds of sponsors in 34 countries on our network; the pandemic forced organizations to accelerate their technology transformation plans.As far as whether clinical research will ever become siteless â€“ I think sites are an invaluable piece of the clinical trial research ecosystem. I see a future thatâ€™s enabled by decentralized clinical trials, but sites will play a strong role in that process. Ultimately, decentralization doesnâ€™t mean siteless, it means localization and allowing more local and community-based health clinics and provider offices to participate in research.Further, I would add that not only are sites vital to a decentralized clinical trial research model, but these trials are beneficial for sites. Looking ahead to a post-COVID landscape, I think sites can expect to benefit from more time for patients, the ability to connect more patients with studies, the freedom to hire new roles to support digital research, the opportunity for more remote work, and increased access to data and real-time observations.Â\\xa0OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹RJ: One final comment I would add about the rise of decentralized clinical trials in the research space is the benefit it has in increasing diversity and inclusion among trial patients. Earlier this year, JAMA published an article on the demographics of vaccine clinical trials from July 2011 to June 2020 â€“ showing how white people were vastly overrepresented in vaccine clinical trials, while Black, Hispanic and Indigenous people were underrepresented. That same trend was seen during COVID vaccine trials when people 65+ were underrepresented even though that population was especially vulnerable to the disease.For cures to be effective, they need to be tested on people of many ages, gender identities, races, and ethnicities. Because decentralized technologies allow research teams to build sites where patients are, and not just where hospitals are, the result is a better chance to include diverse populations in research. At Florence, thatâ€™s something weâ€™re acutely aware of and we are working every day to ensure our platform is optimized to support greater D&I in research.Â\\xa0'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Vivalink, a company offering connected healthcare solutions, has announced the results of a survey checking in with pharma, clinical research, and biotech professionals about remote patient monitoring (RPM). According to the findings, the industry will see a significant increase in RPM technologies and decentralized trial format over the next several months; COVID-19 is a driving factor behind the growth.Among the notable findings:Nearly half (44%) already have adopted RPM, or plan to within the next 12 monthsAbout 65% noted concerns about the pandemic as the reason for using RPMApproximately 94% indicated continuous data capture was somewhat or very important to their trialsOutsourcing-Pharma connected with Sam Liu, vice president of marketing with Vivalink, about the survey, notable findings, and what the respondentsâ€™ perceptions and plans might mean for the industry.OSP: Could you please talk about how the marketâ€™s adoption of DCTs has evolved in recent years?â€‹SL: The first phase of DCT focused on obtaining COA-related data remotely. This limited the amount and automation of data capture and analysis due to largely manual patient-reported symptoms or other observational data capture methods; this is similar to the first phases of telehealth and telemedicine in the healthcare provider world.But now with todayâ€™s remote patient monitoring technologies, advanced software, and back-end integration systems, eCOA is becoming more feasible to adopt. This automates and accelerates data capture, analysis, and insights as well as automating the data process end-to-end.What has changed since COVID is the increase in interest and adoption of eCOA. This was driven largely by the concerns around COVID such as avoidance of human contact which impacted recruitment, enrollment, execution, etc. With a DCT/eCOA approach, the trials are not limited to geography and thus can reach a wider pool of subjects.OSP: Please share an overview of remote patient monitoringâ€”how that tech has evolved, and the types of strategies and technologies sites/sponsors are incorporating in their RPM plans.â€‹SL: Much of the initial and current use of RPM technologies focused on patient reporting via tablets, observations via video conferencing, and manual entries into a computer system. It also made use of simple episodic devices such as BP cuff, ear thermometer, weight scales, etc. While convenient, this also limited the amount of data, contextualization, and insights that can be derived from a patient.With advanced RPM technologies (e.g. continuous monitors such as wearable cardiac ECG patches or multimodal sensing) data can be captured automatically and over an extended period of time. This has the ability to provide more in-depth analysis and insights for applications that require or can benefit from a larger dataset. For example, cardiac safety assessments of a therapeutic can be based on continuous data from wearable ECG patches such that any anomalies throughout a typical 24-hour circadian rhythm, or throughout activities of daily living, can be comprehensively captured.OSP: In your survey, a little under half of the respondents (44%) indicated theyâ€™ve already adopted RPM in their DCTs or will soon. Could you share how the others are handling their patient monitoring needs?â€‹SL: Without the use of RPM technologies in DCT, itâ€™s largely back to relying on data reporting by patients or clinician observations, sometimes limited to a clinic setting and manual entry into computer systems.OSP: Of those respondents who havenâ€™t yet taken on RPM in their decentralized/hybrid trialsâ€”what are some of the factors that might be contributing to the delay or hesitancy?â€‹SL: Most are concerned with how patients will adhere to these new technologies and also understanding the overall complexities of implementation of the system.In Vivalinkâ€™s case, we design our technologies with the consumer in mind. We focus on ease of use and comfort in order to minimize patient burden when applying and using RPM without the assistance of a clinician. For the clinicians, we automate and simplify the entire end-to-end system so that study sponsors and sites are basically utilizing a service where the complexities are largely handled by Vivalink.OSP: You also share the concerns folks have about their RPM execution (i.e. maintaining data integrity, continuous data capture, tracking important physiological parameters, etc). How are trial professionals working to ensure those concerns are addressed?â€‹SL: This is part of our end-to-end systems design. Our technology stack includes functions such as signal filtering for ambulatory and movement-based data capture, on-board sensor memory for continuous data capture in the event of network disruptions, data integrity checks to ensure data captured from remote patients are successfully delivered to the cloud centrally.OSP: What other notable findings in the survey would you like to share?â€‹SL: Almost all the respondents felt that â€˜continuousâ€™ data was important as opposed to just episodic. This speaks to the need for advanced RPM technologies and a peek into the growth and adoption of RPM for DCT.OSP: In what ways is Vivalink working to help organizations get solid RPM solutions and strategies in place?â€‹SL: We consider all aspects of helping our customers to ensure a successful RPM for DCT implementation. This includes not just the technologies behind RPM but incorporating the human factors of ease-of-use, operational issues with training and support, and logistical challenges of getting devices to sites in multiple countries.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'For many men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC), the outlook can be grim. According to Cancer.netâ€‹, While the five-year survival rate for most with local or regional PC is nearly 100%, for those whose cancer has metastasized that rate drops to 30%. It is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the US, with an estimated 34,130 deaths to happen in 2021 alone.Researchers like Niven Narain (president, CEO, and co-founder of Berg) are hoping to help improve the outlook for PC patients by offering improved diagnostics. His company has conducted a study â€œClinical utility of a serum biomarker panel in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasiaâ€‹â€\\x9d in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University (USU) Center for Prostate Disease Research and other key partners that underscores the benefits of using a biomarker panel.Narain spoke with Outsourcing-Panel about the evolution of the PC biomarker panel, the study, and what lies ahead for this novel diagnostic solution.Bergâ€™s Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Department and Defense and the Center for Prostate Disease Research began in 2013, with the goal of coming up with novel cancer diagnostics. According to Narain, the DOD was keenly interested in understanding the difference between PC in members of the military and civilians with regard to diagnoses and outcomes (research out of the Air Forceâ€‹ suggests incidents of PC in pilots is much higher than the rest of the population).Niven Narain, president, CEO, and co-founder, Bergâ€œThey wanted to know what this difference between the military and civilian population with respect to the incidence of PC is, and what may be driving thatâ€‹,â€\\x9d Narain said. He added that the DOD also was interested in using a creative approach and different research methodology because ones employed to that point in time â€œhadn\\'t really led to an appreciable amount of insightâ€‹.â€\\x9dÂ\\xa0The team incorporated a data-driven approach in working on ways to improve and accelerate how PC and other cancers are detected, diagnosed, and treated. According to Narain, employing the companyâ€™s artificial intelligence-based Interrogative Biology platform made it possible for the research collaborators to come up with what is the first AI blood-based biomarker for managing PC as well as and BPH diagnosis.â€œOur intent is that by enhancing clinical decision support that we will be able to establish a more efficient treatment paradigm and potentially reduce fiscal burden to healthcare systems around the worldâ€‹,\" he said.In the PC biomarker study, Berg evaluated more than 750 patients at a diverse list of medical centers in the US and Canada. Researchers applied and evaluated the biomarker panel, which consists of filamin-A (FLNA), age, and prostate volume, to help predict and to stratify men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) from those with PCa.According to the findings, utilizing a biomarker panel can be useful in the following ways:differentiating patients with PC and BPHenhancing patient care in various ways, including reducing unnecessary, invasive biopsiesavoid false negatives, which can delay accurate PC diagnosis and delay treatmentoffer a more effective tool to manage active surveillance.Until now, according to Narain, there have not been any recent significant advancements in PC diagnosisâ€”the typical choice is a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, followed by a rectal examination and biopsy. This path, he said, can be invasive, inaccurate, and costly.Also, Narain said, while there have been notable advancements in research into PC diagnostic tools, this AI-based biomarker panel study stands out.â€œThere\\'s certainly emerging technologies and emerging assays and approaches to constantly look at biomarker development in the prostate cancer world, but nothing like this test that was AI-developed,â€‹â€\\x9d he said.Further, he added, the biomarker panel offers earlier detection than currently available diagnostics.â€œIt gives doctors another weapon in their arsenal against prostate cancerâ€‹,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt helps get ahead of the diseaseâ€‹.â€\\x9dNarain pointed out the accelerated PC diagnosis offered by the biomarker panel could be especially good news for Black patients. According to research by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centerâ€‹, Black men are 50% more likely than white men to develop PC, and are approximately twice as likely to die from the disease.According to Narain, the team is working on its partnership and commercialization strategies and plans to get the diagnostic solution in doctorsâ€™ hands soon.â€œOur goal is to have all the necessary steps completed and the test into doctorsâ€™ hands in the next 12-18 months,â€‹â€\\x9d he told OSP.Narain added that while the biomarker panel does not yet have a price tag, he is confident that the diagnostic solution will cost far less than current options, in addition to offering other benefits.â€œIf the patient has an elevated PSA, the next logical step is taking a biopsyâ€‹,â€\\x9d he commented. â€œThat can cost $3,000â€‹ [USD], and it comes with a risk of infectionâ€”nobody wants to have to deal with thatâ€‹.\"Other collaborators on the biomarker panel study include:John P.

According to experts from Cytel, innovations in statistical methods could help researchers overcome these and other obstacles in conducting studies in such regions.Kyle Wathen, vice president of scientific strategy and innovation with Cytel, shared with Outsourcing-Pharma his views on recent advances in innovative clinical trial design and how this could help organizations bring more new therapies to market, faster and more cost-effectively.Â\\xa0OSP: How do you feel the clinical research industry has dealt with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic? â€‹KW: It is truly remarkable how companies and regulatory agencies have worked together to get effective vaccine trials designed and completed in an unprecedented timescale. This pandemic is unlike anything most of us have ever experienced, and yet the industry has come together and brought several highly effective vaccines to market extremely quickly.COVID-19 made companies embrace innovative technologies to remove the time and resource barriers facing them. Where organizations previously favored (or tolerated) traditional tried and tested techniques, regardless of their flaws, this immediate and urgent need forced organizations to explore novel designs and statistical methods.For example, clinical trials incorporating Bayesian techniques have been deployed, delivering fast and effective results. These are just the first steps in exploring what innovative statistical techniques and clinical trial software have to offer, and we will see the long-term benefits way after COVID-19 is resigned to the history books.OSP: As vaccine rollout progresses and the pandemic seems to be drawing to a close, what challenges still need to be dealt with?â€‹KW: COVID-19 has touched every element of our lives, and whether patients have been infected with the virus or not, there is likely to be a lasting impact on patient health. We are already seeing patient drifts in populations as a result of patients being forced to delay treatment or health screening appointments.This impacts trials in a fundamental way because when patients come into a trial with more progressed conditions, it can be hard to compare these results with earlier trial data. This could then impact how we make decisions in the clinical trial design process. As patients enter trials with more progressed diseases, we will need to adjust the design process so that it accounts for these potential patient drifts.The target disease is not the only thing that will impact results; we already know that mental health issues have increased during the pandemic. Conditions such as anxiety or depression can alter patientsâ€™ quality of life and, combined with greater disease progression, are expected to have an impact on clinical trials. But, predicting the impact is very difficult.Â\\xa0 The pandemic certainly isnâ€™t in the rearview mirror yet â€“ we will feel its effects for years to come.OSP: Why are the Cytel team and its partners calling for statistical innovation to mobilize improvements in clinical research?â€‹KW: The traditional approach to clinical trial design is based on extremely old models and approaches that werenâ€™t even created for medical research. In the race to get new drugs to market, organizations are under pressure to design trials at greater speed and deliver results quickly. This can cause teams to jump straight to the tried and tested models, making simplified assumptions (which may not be valid) and avoiding some of the complexity that comes with exploring innovative designs.Of course, this complexity has been a massive barrier.Â\\xa0 In fast-paced clinical programs, there often isnâ€™t time to take months or years exploring novel designs and employing the deep statistical expertise needed to execute these plans.To meet deadlines, biostatisticians have thus taken a small selection of available designs and tested them in limited clinical scenarios. However, this approach disregards a whole landscape of designs that could be much more effective and help the trial reach its goals sooner and more efficiently.Now, with the recent explosion in cloud-based computational power, trial design analysis that would have taken weeks or months can be completed in hours. This crucial development removes the barrier to exploring the huge complexity of potential trial designs that hold the promise of making studies more efficient and effective.We know that when statistical innovation is used, more efficient clinical trial models are created that can generate superior results. By evaluating the design and operation of trials under realistic conditions, and simulating potential data that match expected trial data, statistical innovation can really add valuable insight beyond what has been done historically.OSP: Which approaches will help achieve these improvements?â€‹KW: Overall, we are gaining a better understanding of natural history and natural disease progression, and when clinical trials use these data in their design and operation, we see more accurate predictive simulations. By using relevant historical data, we can break original assumptions and create a precise picture of how a trial is likely to progress in these situations. Designing a trial in any other way is likely to result in incorrect decisions that lead to ineffective and inefficient trials. No one wants a superior treatment to fail in a clinical trial because of the trial design.OSP: How do clinical research challenges vary from region to region?â€‹Kyle Wathen, VP of scientific strategy and innovation, CytelKW: Similar clinical trial design challenges apply to every region, but some regions have additional challenges. No matter where the study takes place, it must be well thought out and focused on addressing the underlying purpose of the trial. Bridging studies have a role to play in regional trials and can provide an understanding of variations using statistical models and underlying biological data.There are added challenges when conducting randomized clinical trials in low- and middle-income countries, though. Often trials are not properly planned or resourced to meet the needs of these regions, making it difficult to recruit eligible patients, gather robust data, and deliver improved outcomes.We see statistical innovations, such as Bayesian methods and platform trials, as uniquely positioned to help with these issues. By simultaneously evaluating multiple therapies across geographical regions, with the historical data and understanding to provide context, trials can be made more efficient and cost-effective while delivering better patient safety.OSP: What is an â€™adaptive platform trialâ€™ and will this approach improve operation and trial results?â€‹KW: A platform trial is a type of design structure that enables the evaluation of multiple treatments and treatment combinations in a heterogeneous population. Such designs also allow new treatments to be added as the trial is executed.Adaptive platform trials take that one step further by allowing predefined adaptions to be applied based on accruing patient data.Â\\xa0 When you design, set up, and start an adaptive platform trial, you plan for the trial to be able to evaluate treatments that donâ€™t yet exist.There are many benefits to this approach. Firstly, by evaluating multiple treatments in one trial, you improve operational efficiency. Itâ€™s much more efficient to set up a trial if you can test more than two different treatments; sites are more interested in participating if they know that there are wider opportunities with the potential for further therapies to be added.However, the biggest benefit sits firmly with the patient. As the trial progresses, innovative statistical analysis and modeling enable the benefits of randomization and treatment comparison to be realized with smaller control groups. This means increasingly fewer patients are treated with the control as the trial progresses.This is just one way in which trials are adapted â€“ weâ€™ve also seen some great work with patient sub-groups. For example, when patients are showing good responses to treatments, the algorithms increase the likelihood of new patients receiving effective treatments.By using advanced statistical techniques, we will see trials flexing to accommodate the needs of the patients and their response to treatment. Of course, adaptations are pre-specified at the very beginning of the trial, so at no point does it veer off course; the trial simply adapts to the pre-defined qualifications determined in the design stages.Designing a trial of this nature requires an incredible amount of expertise and experience in both frequentist and Bayesian techniques. But with the use of in-trial decision-support tools, the creation and evaluation of designs that lead to these complex, yet hugely efficient and effective, trials can be accelerated, enabling biostatisticians to add further value to the design process.OSP: How will increased adoption of Bayesian techniques help elevate clinical trial operation and outcomes?â€‹KW: Adaptive Bayesian techniques are the most natural way of including historical and in-trial data to inform and adapt the course of the trial and provide a more intuitive interpretation of the results. Adaptive trials use Bayesian techniques because they enable considered in-trial changes.Clinical trial managers can quickly decide whether a treatment looks to be more beneficial than a control, allowing the flexibility to move resources and patients to more effective trials if needed. Direct comparisons can also be made against available treatments, and if the new drug is shown to be less effective, then trials can be stopped early.Â\\xa0In addition, Bayesian techniques allow you to make statements that are easily, and correctly, interpreted by many people â€“ including those not highly trained in statistics. For example, a Bayesian approach allows you to make statements like, the probability the new treatment is more effective than controls is 98%. Using traditional methods, you could not make this type of statement.Â\\xa0OSP: Is there anything else you like to share about innovative clinical trial design?â€‹KW: One of the most important things the industry needs to address is how we see the role of the biostatistician in clinical trials. Designing a clinical trial needs to be a team effort with the biostatistician integrated as a central part of the team, alongside clinical, operations, and patient advocacy groups.Biostatisticians have been stifled with limited methods and computational power, meaning they can only explore a few design options and are often only consulted at the beginning and end of a trial. Eroding these barriers has been a key focus for us in the development of our enabling technology platforms.With innovative statistical methods and the ease and power of cloud-based computing, biostatisticians can evaluate an expansive design space and explore innovative designs for more effective trials that deliver treatments more swiftly.For example, our Solara system is a clinical strategy platform that not only provides this enormous computational power but also the collaborative workspace to allow cross-functional discussion during trial selection. With this framework, the biostatistician has a comprehensive view of each potential trial design under consideration, the futility and success factors of every design, and the impact of each on the trial operation. By using visualization tools, team consensus can be made on the most effective trial design.As organizations embrace the idea of innovation groups (diverse teams of stakeholders from across the clinical trial design and operation space) and access the tools necessary for fast simulations, biostatisticians are freed from more manual statistical tasks and can step into the strategic space, adding more value to the design and operation of clinical trials.To do this, organizations need to move away from the mentality of designing a study in the way itâ€™s always been done. When we find better, quicker, and more efficient ways to design trials, we are more likely to identify treatments that will ultimately save lives.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Thanks to a number of factorsâ€”outreach efforts, media coverage, visibility into the development of COVID-19 vaccinesâ€”the public is increasingly cognizant of clinical trials, how studies work, and the benefits of participation. Gerard Baron, vice president of operations with Illingworth Research Group, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about how an increasingly educated patient population has affected what they expect of the study experience, and how trial teams should adapt.OSP: How can a patientâ€™s level of familiarity with the way clinical research operates impact their experience and the data collected?â€‹GB: Well, the more a patient understands the goal of a clinical trialâ€”and the value of their own role in itâ€”the more likely they are to be engaged and compliant, and the more likely they are to stay enrolled throughout the duration of the trial. Obviously, compliance and retention are both essential to good overall trial data.One way to boost patient engagement is for patients to take a more active role in the data collection itself, to feel like a participant in the research, as opposed to a subject of, or worse, a mere number in it.OSP: Does this vary with on-site trials versus decentralized studies?â€‹GB: Yes, on-site trials and decentralized studies have very different levels and natures of patient engagement. Remote digital technologies, such as wearables and other mHealth devices, are driving change because for the first time patients can actually see how their behavior affects their health in real time. That can be very powerful.Their devices capture everything from heart rate to blood oxygen level to far more esoteric measurements, and instead of the reading being taken by a technician and simply entered in their record, the patients are directly involved. For studies on disease states with a strong behavioral component, that can be transformative. Recently, clinical trial staff have been taking a much closer look at how to manage and incorporate data collected by patientsâ€”both self-reported and through personal devices.OSP: Has COVID-19 and the publicity about vaccine trials impacted patientsâ€™ awareness of trials, and the ins and outs of studies?â€‹GB: Absolutely! I canâ€™t tell you how many people had no idea what a clinical trial was a year ago. But now, having heard about trials in daily news cycles for more than a year, they understand the need for them, the goals of a trial, the need for patient participationâ€”and that there may well be trials occurring around a disease state or health issue that they suffer from.People know now to proactively ask their doctors if there might be a trial they should participate in. This trend should help overall trial recruitment. But, of course, a knowledgeable patient is also a savvy patientâ€”one with expectations and demands. So, it works both ways, and we must be prepared to adapt and respond to more engaged patient participation.OSP: Could you please talk about the difference in familiarity with how trials work between rare/orphan diseases and more common conditions?â€‹GB: The rare disease community tends to be tight-knit and more self-informed. They rely less on the opinion of a single expert; they augment what they are told with their own research. A tremendous percentage of rare diseases present in childhood, and the desperate parents of these children turn over every stone in the search for hope of any kind. They trade information, not only about treatments but about the research that is being done.So, they know about clinical trials in a broad sense, andâ€‹ they know about the mechanisms of specific trials. For instance, they know that Trial A is using remote monitoring or home visitsâ€”and theyâ€™ll want to know why Trial B canâ€™t do that, too.OSP: How might a trial team differ in their handling of a patient that is more knowledgeable, compared to a patient who comes in knowing less about trials?â€‹Gerard Baron, VP of operations, Illingworth Research GroupGB: Certainly with the â€œrise of the savvy patientâ€\\x9d a new approach will be required from the start. During recruitment, the trial team is going to have to enumerate the things they will do to make the trial easy for the patientâ€”and minimizing or eliminating travel is a big part of that.Squeezing in a clinical trial visit from somebody who rings your doorbell or comes to your school or work location and stays for an hour is a lot easier than having to take time off work or school, figure out childcare, and deal with transportation. Essentially, the trial team really needs to look at every aspect of their study through a patient-centric lens. And thatâ€™s true whether the patient is knowledgeable or not.OSP: If a patient enters with specific expectations of how theyâ€™ll be treated, compensation, communication, etc., does that make things easier for sites and sponsors, more complicated, or just different?â€‹GB: I imagine that many sites long for the days when they set the parameters and the patients complied. Yet, in some ways savvy patients make everything more straightforward; you know precisely where you stand.We were involved in a trial with a large academic hospital. The first two patients who enrolled in the study dropped out because they didnâ€™t want to have to stay at the site. That was a pretty clear message. Ultimately, we were able to keep them in the trial, because we brought the trial to them.OSP: How is the rise in at-home trial operations impacting patient perceptions and expectations?â€‹GB: During the height of the pandemic, sponsors were eager to find ways to keep patients enrolled in trials. With patientsâ€™ well-founded fear of contagion, both travel to sites and even visits to more local hospitals were more or less off-limits. So, sponsors sought mechanisms that enabled the patient to stay in their own homes.Fortunately, technology provided, with a range of mHealth devices. Those were augmented by mobile research nursing providers who brought diagnostics and monitoring to the patients. Guess what? Patients preferred the convenience of not having to go to trial sites.Now that they have experienced what is possible, patients increasingly expect it, pandemic or not. Itâ€™s not dissimilar, perhaps, to what many have learned about working from home in the course of the pandemic.OSP: What advice would you offer any clinical research professionals in dealing with an increasingly savvy patient population?â€‹GB: I think sponsors and trial sites have to face the reality that patient expectations have shifted. The industry has permanently changed; we arenâ€™t going back to the way things were.Bringing the trial to the patient can help retention. Itâ€™s not just about COVID-19 safety; there are economic burdens that patients shoulder when they have to disrupt their lives and travel to a site. Plus, patients are now interested in being more actively engaged with the trials.Again, technology can help meet these new expectations. Of course, remote technology isnâ€™t without issues. There are concerns around patient privacy, as well as data integrity and consistency across devices. And on the sponsor side, there is a question of new protocols, as well as increased expense for sites to manage data that is collected remotely.OSP: What role do home health trial service providers like Illingworth play in helping address these challenges?â€‹GB: Overall, the sponsorsâ€™ biggest concern about remote and decentralized trials is whether the data will be as clean as it would be coming from a site. The answer is: It can be. And mobile research nursing providers can play a large role in ensuring that it is.Fundamentally, real-time-reporting wearables and home health nurses go hand in hand to enable continuous health monitoring. Often patients need help setting up wearables and apps accurately; mobile nurses can help with that. They can also mitigate concerns about data integrity by having standardized processes, synchronized SOPs, and ensuring that all equipment is uniformly calibrated.Clinical trial sites arenâ€™t going away, but mobile nursing will be key to bridging the need for professional oversight with patientsâ€™ desire not to be tethered to sites.

Curebase has unique experience in digital therapeutics, which has become a large component of all current business. Curebase's unique integrations and APIs allow for digital therapeutics to connect and work together with Curebase's clinical workflow.Additionally, Curebase has designed the platform for useability around study designs that digital therapeutics lean on. Curebase operates as a complete eClinical software platform and virtual research site that can be added to any study, ongoing or just getting started.OSP: Please tell how you came to join up with AppliedVR on this projectâ€”did you connect through an event or association, have you worked together on previous projects, etc.?â€‹Tom Lemberg, CEO and founder, CurebaseTL: AppliedVR is committed to being the most evidence-based solution in healthcare and is currently working through its de novo FDA approval. However, the company is very interested in running many more studies to demonstrate both the effectiveness of its solution for treating chronic pain and its ability to lower costs.So, AppliedVR reached out to Curebase earlier this year after hearing about all the work we have been doing in digital therapeutics. They sought to understand more about how our system uniquely adapted to digital therapeutic study designs and wanted a partner with this unique experience.OSP: Please tell a bit about VR, and some of the ways itâ€™s been used in general patient care, pain management specifically, and also clinical research.â€‹TL: Virtual reality's use in healthcare has been growing significantly, and has been shown in multiple studies to be a powerful therapeutic for everything from reducing pain to treating anxiety. It's been used to help veterans deal with many healthcare challenges, including stress and anxiety.AppliedVR has even deployed its treatments to help with the pain associated with childbirth and wound debridement for severe burn victims -- two of the most painful experiences that someone can face. Now, with the opioid crisis in America still a huge issue, AppliedVR is focusing on chronic pain via its EaseVRx solution, which is shown to be effective at reducing multiple pain indicators and can be a solid opioid-sparing treatment.OSP: Could you tell us a bit about AppliedVRâ€™s pain management platform, and why itâ€™s a good fit for this project?â€‹TL: AppliedVR has been a pioneer in advancing the next generation of digital medicine and has created multiple programs for treating both acute and chronic pain. Currently, its EaseVRx platform that's for treating chronic pain, which a Johns Hopkins study in the Journal of Pain found can cumulatively cost as high as $635 billion a year â€” more than the annual costs of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes â€” is its primary focus.EaseVRx is an eight-week program that can be self-administered in the home, making it a great tool for people suffering from chronic pain. The solution recently received breakthrough device designation from the FDA, and the company expects to have its de novo approval soon.Because it's meant for the remote treatment of pain, that necessitates a study design that replicates the intended use environment. That's why Curebase was the perfect fit for all AppliedVR's studies. Curebase enables remote research, so AppliedVR's product can be used as intended, by patients in a home setting.OSP: Then, could you share a little more detail about what each partner is bringing to the table?â€‹TL: Curebase's software platform and services will enable AppliedVR to conduct research studies more quickly and in any setting (home, community, etc.). This will allow AppliedVR to gain the necessary clinical data it requires to build a better body of evidence for both FDA approval and to get payers on board with reimbursement.AppliedVR brings a deep understanding of user experience and clinical endpoints for VR therapy to tailor the most scientifically rigorous study designs that also have the highest degree of patient satisfaction.OSP: Do you have anything else to add?â€‹TL: We're excited for the future of this partnership and are looking forward to sharing the results of the studies in the near future. As digital medicine, and VR specifically, find more places to have a greater impact on health, the sky is unlimited for the category.Digital therapeutics as a category are showing that not everyone needs a pharmacological intervention, and solutions like AppliedVR demonstrate that digital medicine can not only be effective at treating the most costly and complex health concerns, they also can be used just as easily as taking a pill.\"},\n",

The investigational adenovirus vector vaccine vaccine was found to have a favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events; but did not meet its primary endpoint with a vaccine efficacy of only 25.2%.The study was run by Janssen and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.â€œThe development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection has proven to be a formidable scientific challenge,â€\\x9dâ€‹ said NIAID Director Anthony S.

The vaccine candidate uses a strain of common-cold virus (adenovirus serotype 26, or Ad26) to deliver four mosaic antigens to spur an immune response.Â\\xa0Imbokodo, a Phase 2b proof-of-concept efficacy study of the vaccine, began in 2017, reached full enrollment in 2019 and completed vaccinations on June 30, 2020. The study enrolled approximately 2,600 young women across five countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where women and girls accounted for 63% of all new HIV infections in 2020. The study took place at 23 trial sites in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The Imbokodo vaccine regimen was administered to participants through four vaccination visits over one year; with the primary analysis 24 months after the first vaccination. The studyâ€™s primary endpoint was based on the difference in number of new HIV infections between the placebo and vaccine groups from month seven (one month after the third vaccination timepoint) through month 24.These data found that through 24 months of follow up, 63 of 1,109 participants who received placebo compared to 51 of 1,079 participants who received active vaccine acquired HIV. This analysis demonstrated a vaccine efficacy point estimate of 25.2% (95% confidence interval of -10.5% to 49.3%).Â\\xa0Further analysis of the Imbokodo study will continue, and the study is thought to have provided sufficient data for further immunological correlates research.Â\\xa0Mosaico study to continueThe Imbokodo vaccine study tested an adenovirus vector containing four mosaic immunogens (Ad26.Mos4.HIV) at four vaccination visits over one year.The regimen contained a soluble protein component (Clade C gp140, adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate) which was administered at vaccination visits three and four.The ongoing Phase 3 Mosaico study,â€‹â€‹ however, is testing a different investigational vaccine regimen that involves the administration of a mosaic-based mixture of soluble proteins (Clade C/Mosaic gp140) at vaccination visits three and four.Furthermore, the study is being conducted among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender individuals; in the Americas and Europe where different strains of HIV are circulating.Given these differentiating factors and following consultations with the Mosaico study independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), it was decided that the Mosaico study will continue at this time.Having started in 2019, the study has a target enrolment of 3,800 individuals aged 18-60. The study is expected to be completed in March 2024.â€œWe are extremely grateful to the women who volunteered for the Imbokodo study, and to our partners, including the people on the frontlines, all of whom are contributing every day to this enduring quest to make HIV history,â€\\x9dâ€‹ said Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer at Johnson & Johnson.â€œHIV is a unique and complex virus that has long posed unprecedented challenges for vaccine development because of its ability to attack, hijack and evade the human immune system. While we are disappointed that the vaccine candidate did not provide a sufficient level of protection against HIV infection in the Imbokodo trial, the study will give us important scientific findings in the ongoing pursuit for a vaccine to prevent HIV. We continue to stand in solidarity with people living with and vulnerable to HIV, and remain committed to furthering our research against this devastating virus.â€\\x9dâ€‹Johnson & Johnson has been working on HIV prevention and care for 25 years, having played a role in bringing nine therapeutics to people living with HIV.Â\\xa0 It started work on a potential HIV vaccine in 2005.Â\\xa0'},\n",

              "  'D': \"TrialJectory, a company that offers an artificial intelligence-based platform connecting cancer patients to research, has announced results from a survey on cancer patients and genetic testing. According to the responses, while the majority of those surveyed (90%) know that genetic testing is useful in improving clinical outcomes, under half of them (46%) have reported undergoing next-generation sequencing (NGS), used to identify cancer mutations and familiar cancer mutation carriers.Tzvia Bader, TrialJectory CEO and co-founder, spoke with Outsourcing-Pharma about the power of precision medicine, the usefulness of genetic testing in cancer treatment, and how these barriers to necessary testing might be lifted.OSP: Could you talk about the recent history of genetic testing, especially as it relates to cancer treatment/diagnostics?â€‹TB: Historically NGS testing was used to inform complex treatment decisions for cancer patients. This approach, which is also referred to as â€˜precision' or â€˜personalized medicineâ€™ focuses on identifying which treatments will be effective for which patients based on their genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.However, it is increasingly important for patients to utilize the capabilities of NGS testing to take full advantage of todayâ€™s precision medicine and improve outcomes.OSP: As you point out, thereâ€™s a gap between patients who are interested in, and understand the usefulness of, genetic testing and NGS specifically. Could you please share some of the reasons for that gap?â€‹TB: First, it's important to note that according to the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines - all cancer patients should undergo NGS testingâ€‹. However, in a recent survey of cancer patients, only 46% reported having undergone NGS testing, and 90% of these patients understand the importance of genetic testing when it comes to improving clinical outcomes. And thereâ€™s the gap.OSP: Similarly, you talk about the â€˜artificialâ€™ barriers standing between cancer patients and genetic testingâ€”could you please share why these are artificial obstacles, and how to remove them?â€‹TB: When we talk about â€˜artificial barriersâ€™ weâ€™re referencing the potential reasons why patients do not receive NGS testing as a standard practice. One of the primary barriers is physician bandwidth. Even before the pandemic, the doctorâ€™s time with the patient was limited. Post-COVID, these same doctors are managing a backlog of cancer patients that were forced to put testing and treatment on hold further reducing their availability.A second barrier is the trend among physicians to focus primarily on the standard-of-care treatment plan. Based on their experience and the speed at which they can get a program started, many doctors donâ€™t consider new treatment pathways, including clinical trials, and therefore donâ€™t see a need to recommend NGS testing. On top of that, healthcare insurance does not cover genetic testing for some cancer types - making it even more of a challenge for patients.I will say in closing that there is an assumption that the doctor knows about every available treatment option for each of their patients. If you take a step back, that assumption is just unrealistic - and quite frankly, humanly impossible.Weâ€™re starting to see a shift in this thinking among cancer patients who are taking more of a leadership role in their healthcare decisions. This increased level of involvement should and does include a request to receive NGS testing.Â\\xa0 With more information, a cancer patient has access to more treatment options which can improve their clinical outcome.Â\\xa0\"},\n",

              "  'D': 'Racial disparities in healthcare (detailed in the National Healthcare Quality Disparities Reportâ€‹ issued by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) run parallel to inequity in clinical research. This inequality can have deadly consequences for the underrepresented groups, particularly when it comes to Black women diagnosed with breast cancer; they are far more likely to get breast cancer, die from it, or suffer a recurrence than white women.Touch, the Black Breast Cancer Allianceâ€‹ is working to help eliminate these inequities in care and research, and to give Black women a fighting chance against the disease. Pitching in is health data company Ciitizen who has partnered with the org to start the #BlackDataMatters in order to encourage women to sign up for trials and pinpoint genetic differences that impact care.Outsourcing-Pharma connected with two leaders in the effort to discuss the significant disparities in breast cancer, and the importance of working to increase the voice of Black breast cancer patients in research:Ricki Fairley, CEO at Touch, the Black Breast Cancer AllianceAlexa Berk, Head of Research and Real-World Evidence, CiitizenOSP: Could you please talk about the growing awareness of racial and gender disparities in healthcare and research, and some of the key reasons why this awareness is important?â€‹RF: Awareness of disparities is critical because of the devastating mortality statistics for Black women:Black women have a 40% higher likelihood of dying from breast cancer than white women (ACS).Black women with breast cancer have a 71% higher risk of death than white women (JAMA Oncology, 2021).Black women have a 39% higher recurrence rate than white women (Phase III TAILORx Trial).Black women under 35 get breast cancer at twice the rate and die at three times the rate as white women (ACS).Approximately 19% of breast cancers diagnosed in Black women are triple-negative breast cancer compared to 9% in white women, and Black women with triple-negative breast cancer have a 28% increased risk of death compared with white women (Oncotarget, 2017).There is a dire need for Black Women to participate in clinical research to bring the necessary science to Black breast cancer. In order to help growing awareness of racial and gender disparities effectively, we must overcome the huge barrier of mistrust based on the harmful scientific history of exploitation and racism by providing tools that give people of color the confidence that their data will be protected and safe.AB: Unfortunately, health disparities are not a new topic; Martin Luther King stated in 1966, â€œOf all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results in physical deathâ€‹.â€\\x9d Fifty-five years later, we are still living with this dangerous inequity, although certain things have brought the topic into sharper focus recently.The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted certain minority groups, which brought the topic of health disparities into the mainstream as an urgent public health matter. In addition, recent technological advancements in data-driven research and real-world evidence have revealed trends and patterns in healthcare outcomes by demographic characteristics, identifying powerful differences in the healthcare experiences of all Americans.Understanding these disparities is the first step in potentially addressing them - whether that be through patient education, better screening and prevention tools, targeted drug development, or improving access to life-saving treatment.OSP: Particularly, why is it important to increase equity in care with Black women?â€‹AB: When we talk about health disparities, two of the biggest drivers are differences in genetics and biology as well as the impact of what we call â€œsocial determinants of health.â€\\x9d Social determinants of health, as defined by the CDC, are â€œconditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes.â€\\x9dUnfortunately, we see that Black women, in addition to any potential biological and genetic factors, are oftentimes facing multiple adversities in their social determinants of health - economically, environmentally, and as people facing multiple different forms of bias and injustice. It is this intersectionality of multiple factors that leads to Black women experiencing some of the worst health outcomes across disease areas, which must be addressed comprehensively.Ricki Fairley, CEO, Touch, the Black Breast Cancer AllianceRF: Breast cancer in Black women is a distinct disease that deserves special attention and focuses on the breast cancer ecosystem. The physiology of Black women has not been a significant consideration in clinical trial research, and the average participation by Black women in breast cancer clinical trialsâ€‹ overall is less than 3%. Part of the reluctance to get involved in medical research can be attributed to the fact that nearly one-third of us believe scientists cannot be trusted, compared to 4% of white women.OSP: Do you think you could speak to some of the apparent disparities in oncology in general, and breast cancer specifically?â€‹RF: Black breast cancer patients die at a 40% higher rateâ€‹ than white breast cancer patients, and these devastating mortality numbers will not change until we better understand the physiology of Black women. When theyâ€™re not in clinical trials, they miss access to newly emerging and often life-extending treatments not otherwise available. Until there are more Black women included in clinical research, we cannot end these disparities.AB: There are several cancer types where we see significantly higher incidence and/or mortality in Black patients compared with white, meaning Black men and women are much more likely to get these diseases and disproportionately likely to die from them. For example, prostate cancer incidence is about 60% higher in Black men than it is in white men, with a 2-3 times higher mortality rate.Similarly, in colorectal cancer, we see Black men and women have a 20% higher incidence rate and a 40% higher mortality rate. Within breast cancer, although Black and white women tend to get breast cancer at relatively similar rates, Black women are 42% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts. These health disparities are concerning and something that must be urgently addressed by oncology researchers.OSP: Please tell me about the #BlackDataMatters initiativeâ€”how Ricki started it, how Ciitizen contributed, the goals of the movement, and what youâ€™ve accomplished so far.â€‹RF: Starting with black breast cancer, the mission of #BlackDataMatters is to put patients in a position of power to directly change the research and medical system that often fails black patients. This initiative is led by Touch, The Black Breast Cancer Alliance, and Morehouse School of Medicine, which are powered by Ciitizen. Ciitizen makes it easy for patients to be in control of their health data.Ciitizen collects, digitizes, and organizes their medical records making them research-ready. Through Black Data Matters, Ciitizen creates access to research opportunities for their community. When all of a patientâ€™s medical data is in Ciitizen profile, not only is the data secure/private, but the patient is also then empowered to choose if they want to contribute to life-saving research.AB: Underrepresentation in research is one of the biggest sources of health disparities, especially in cancer and most specifically in breast cancer. Black women continue to be drastically underrepresented in breast cancer clinical trials, constituting only 3% of the participants in the breast cancer clinical trials that led to FDA approvals between 2008-2018; this prevents researchers from understanding specifically how new products perform in this population, and it keeps black women from having access to potentially life-saving treatment options which are offered in clinical trials.We, therefore, chose to examine the participation of Black patients in breast cancer clinical trials as the topic of our first research collaboration for the #BlackDataMatters initiative. This research study included two phases - a qualitative study with 48 participants, and a larger quantitative survey of over 250 patients which has recently completed data collection and is currently undergoing data analysis.One of the most exciting things about this research is that we have engagement from the Black breast cancer patient community through Rickiâ€™s advocacy work, and also access to deep rich clinical data on these patients through the Ciitizen platform. The qualitative study showed some interesting findings regarding the tactical, logistical, cultural, and emotional barriers that Black breast cancer patients face when considering clinical trials.We are excited to disseminate these findings in the coming months and to expand our work together.OSP: Specifically, could you tell us about the partnershipâ€™s work to pinpoint genetic and biological differences in Black patients?â€‹AB: One of the most exciting things about the Ciitizen platform is our ability to extract disease and treatment information from the entire medical record for each participating patient - we are not dependent upon just what is in a structured EHR or claims dataset. We, therefore, have important clinical and genomic data on our patients such as their molecular subtype and biomarker status, as well as an understanding of their treatment outcomes.For patients who consent to share their data for research through our platform, we are able to look for correlations between these variables. We are also working with innovative collaborators such as Dr. James Lillard at the Morehouse School of Medicine, whose Total Cancer Care research study is examining this topic in-depth and democratizing access to oncogenic data for cancer patients who are traditionally underserved in this area.OSP: Could you please share some of the ways Black women could more effectively advocate for their care?â€‹RF: Black women need more health literacy to be able to effectively advocate for their care. They need education on their health options and an understanding of their HERstory. Black families donâ€™t readily talk about health in their households and because 74% of Black women are breadwinners for their families (IWPR analysis of American Community Survey microdata), they donâ€™t want to burden their families with their health issues.We need to make health and specifically breast health a kitchen table conversation for black families. We need to encourage open discussions and provide them with the knowledge they need to be poised to advocate for themselves. We have an HBCU internship program to teach young women about breast health to help them bring awareness to their peers, as well as serve as the catalyst for bringing the necessary health conversations to their families.AB: This is a complicated question, as oftentimes we see unfortunately the Black women who are patients are doing everything they can to advocate for themselves but are faced with a series of barriers in obtaining optimal care. These barriers can be due to things such as their environment, the cost of care, deeply ingrained cultural beliefs, and either explicit or implicit bias on the part of some healthcare providers, unfortunately.That said, one of the most effective things any patient can do is engage with a patient advocacy group early in their treatment journey. There is tremendous benefit from being supported by other patients who have walked the road you are about to travel.Rickiâ€™s Touch, the Black Breast Cancer Alliance is a perfect example of a patient advocacy group that draws on the strength of a community of Black women who are living with breast cancer. Itâ€™s also important that patients not be afraid to seek a second (or third or fourth!) opinion.Black women should know that they have the right to seek out other options to ensure they are 100% confident with their treatment options and care. Empowering yourself with your medical records - which is the core mission of Ciitizen - is one way to facilitate getting second opinions and taking an active role in your treatment decision-making.OSP: Please talk about some of the other ways you expect this disparity of care to change and improve down the road.â€‹Alexa Berk, Head of Research and Real-World Evidence, CiitizenAB: Research is certainly going to be a huge driver of improvement in health disparities - identifying where the disparities exist and understanding their causes, whether these be biological differences, social determinants of health, provider bias, etc. Collaboration between patient advocacy groups, innovative technology offerings, academics, and life sciences researchers - breaking down these silos - will be crucial as well in addressing this complex issue.Empowering patients to be at the center of the conversation - by giving them tools such as access to their own medical data - will also be key. Ultimately, improvements will be driven by the patients, by courageous voices like Rickiâ€™s, as the ones demanding change.RF: Our hope is that this disparity of care will change as we educate Black women and empower them with confidence to ask questions on their behalf and demand the care they deserve from doctors. We are starting a movement to arm them with the information they need to challenge their doctors to do what is best for them. Our community-based/grass-roots education campaign is designed to reach Black women where they live, work, play and pray.OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹AB: I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important topic. At Ciitizen we feel strongly about empowering patients - through access to their medical records, by providing them with opportunities to participate in research initiatives such as #BlackDataMatters, and by unique, innovative patient-facing offerings such as our clinical trial matching tool.Our goal is to break down many of the traditional barriers in healthcare that have historically contributed to health disparities. We are fortunate to have forward-thinking partners such as Ricki who are helping us bring this tool to all patients, across lines of race, gender, and geography.RF: The time is now for this change. Black breast cancer can no longer be ignored. I donâ€™t want anyone to die of breast cancer but, at a minimum, Black women deserve mortality rate parity for breast cancer.'},\n",

              "  'D': 'Cota, an oncology-focused real-world data (RWD) and analytics firm, has announced finding from a study looking into how cancer patients and their immediate families perceive cancer trials and drug development. The study reveals a number of thoughts and feelingsâ€”for example, approximately 66% of those surveyed believe trials geared toward cancer treatments and therapies arenâ€™t moving fast enough.The study checked in with 1,110 people in the US who either have had cancer or have had someone in their family diagnosed with cancer. CK Wang, Cotaâ€™s chief medical officer, said his personal experience with cancer patients has offered insight into how a cancer diagnosis can impact patients and their loved ones.â€œAs an oncologist, I have seen firsthand how devastating a cancer diagnosis is for a patient and their familyâ€‹,â€\\x9d Wang said. â€œIt is hard to not look back and question whether some of my patients would have survived had innovations specific to cancer care and treatment been accelerated through highly focused funding, research, technology, and innovative collaborations like those prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccineâ€‹.â€\\x9dOperation Warp Speed (OWS), the ultimately successful effort to fast-track the creation and adoption of vaccines for COVID-19, reportedly has helped to reinforce expectations that the development of cancer treatments can, and should, be accelerated. About half of study respondents overall specifically cited following reports of vaccine development and deployment have led them to believe cancer treatments should be developed more rapidly, with patients themselves slightly more likely (about 60%) to hold that belief.While recent data indicates an overall decline in cancer deaths overall between the years of 2014 and 2018, researchers have noted an increase in both certain types of cancers, and in specific populations. For example, the incidence of cancer has increased in women, children, teens, and young adults.Whatâ€™s more, Black Americans and other racial minorities continue to experience higher death rates and lower survival rates, with Black patients themselves being the lowest. In the Cota study, respondentsâ€™ perception of clinical trial representation does not reflect realityâ€”while Black, Latino, and other patient groups are woefully underrepresented, 82% of survey respondents believe current trials are inclusive.â€œWhat has been reinforced by the pandemic and what we already know from advanced cancer research, is that â€” despite what patients may believe â€” not all people are equally represented in cancer clinical trials â€” and that has to changeâ€‹,â€\\x9d Wang added.The lack of representation in trials and overrepresentation in cancer cases among certain populations has attracted the attention of both industry professionals and government leaders. For example, the US Cancer Moonshotâ€‹ is a federally backed effort to accelerate research, and President Joe Bidenâ€™s administration recently called for a $9b USD increase in National Institutes of Health funding to help address cancer challenges.The Cota study found nearly 90% of respondents support cancer patients anonymously sharing health data in order to help advance the research, discovery, and development of treatments. Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, said, â€œSharing anonymized personal health data gives patients a sense of control and allows them to contribute to the greater good; given growing concerns related to an uptick in cancer cases due to delayed treatments and screenings â€” as well as the significant impact of COVID-19 on blood cancer patients in particular â€” it is critical for cancer patients to take an active and collaborative role in solving for cancer treatments and cures moving forwardâ€‹.â€\\x9dÂ\\xa0Other study findings:87% of respondents indicated they would not care if their data had already been anonymously shared86% think cancer doctors should discuss the value of sharing data with researchers as part of patient interactions85% said they would agree to share their anonymous data if their doctor asked53% believe a cure would already be in hand if all cancer patient data were collected and combined.â€œAs technology and smart, standardized data practices have advanced, patients have clearly become more understanding and willing to contribute their data to the greater good. Clinicians have an important role to play in encouraging patients to be part of the solution to accelerating cancer innovationâ€‹,â€\\x9d said Wang. â€œThe more real-world data we have from cancer patients, the more successful we will be in building treatments and therapies that save livesâ€‹.â€\\x9dThe Cota survey was conducted by PureSpectrum, a market research platform that gathers insights through online, nonprobability samples collected from panels.'},\n",

We ran a phase 2a trial around gout in 2015 with Bucillamine. After looking at the data, based on its anti-inflammatory history and a few other properties, it led us to advance our efforts in reviving and repurposing the drug as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug has also been shown to be effective for inflammation around reperfusion injury and organ transplantation.Once the FDA had the chance to look at the historical data of Bucillamine, safety and profile, and our open IND they fast-tracked the trial into a Phase III. The current trial, led by Kelly Mckee and our team is now looking at 600 patients by the end of September 2021 and finishing the 1000-person study in Q4. We have made tremendous progress over the last few months by engaging over 40 clinical sites, and we plan to expand to 50 sites and target COVID hot spots.OSP: Please tell us some of the properties of the drug, and notable findings in the research to date, that are helping Revive feed positive about the treatmentâ€™s chances of achieving full approval down the road.â€‹MF: I canâ€™t really get into the core details at the moment since weâ€™re still in a clinical trial, but you are more than welcome to read about our ongoing study posted on clinicaltrials.govâ€‹. At a high level, the history of Buccillamine is an anti-rheumatoid and inflammatory drug for arthritis. It has properties that enhance glutathione, a natural substance in the body and an antioxidant.Buccillamine is a powerful mechanism to produce glutathione. In fact, itâ€™s 16x more potent than N-Acetylcysteine/NAC, a drug that is also currently in trials as a treatment for COVID-19.In the event that someone gets COVID-19 which causes inflammation there usually is a cytokine storm. This overproduction of cytokines causes inflammation around a lot of the organs including the lungs. Based on the history of this drug, weâ€™re confident that it will have good efficacy.OSP: To date, COVID-19 treatment has focused on symptoms; why is it preferable to have the option of an approved treatment for the virus itself?â€‹MF: Although the availability of the vaccine has been shown to reduce hospitalization, breakthrough infections are happening. Whether someone is vaccinated, yet to be vaccinated or vaccine-hesitant, people are still getting COVID. Vaccines also have an issue with efficacy after a certain amount of time, and itâ€™s hard to move vaccines out to third-world countries and areas that donâ€™t have access to them.Some people talk about monoclonal antibodies, which is another therapeutic, but itâ€™s hard to take because it's intravenous. Thereâ€™s a need for oral treatments.This virus comes with a lot of side effects, and the drug we have has a strong history and safety profile. It can be taken on its own or in conjunction with other treatments. Oral therapeutics are essential for logistic deployment.OSP: Do you have anything to add?â€‹MF: These types of viruses will potentially continue, whether Delta stays for a while or it mutates to become another variant. A pill/ treatment is highly beneficial and essential as these are not tied to only one strain, it can work with different forms of a virus and thatâ€™s very important.\"},\n",

Raja Sharif, CEO of FarmaTrust, discussed the consortium with Outsourcing-Pharma and explained why such solutions are necessary for the future of the industry.OSP: Could you please share a short description of FarmaTrustâ€”who you are, what you do, key capabilities, and what sets you apart from other companies in this arena?â€‹RS: FarmaTrust is a digital supply chain solution and technology provider for pharmaceutical supply chains â€“ we use distributed ledger technology (blockchains) to create end-to-end transparency and unalterable supply chain records to ensure safety and authenticity of pharmaceutical products. Our mission is to protect patients, eliminate counterfeit products, increase efficiency, and provide advanced data analytics tools.OSP: Please explain what we mean when we use the term â€œdigital supply chain.â€\\x9dâ€‹RS: A digital supply chain is simply a digital record of all parts of the supply chain including has custodianship, where the product has been, for how long, and even under what conditions â€“ it means we track in real time exactly where a pharmaceutical therapy is and this makes it far, far harder for medicines to leave the supply chain for counterfeits to enter.OSP: Could you please explain the concept of smart medicine, why itâ€™s beneficial to patients, and how FarmaTrustâ€™s technology will help advance it?â€‹Raja Sharif, CEO, FarmaTrustRS: Taking the digital supply chain, we have the ability to enter an increasing number of stakeholders into the supply chain using smart contracts and this means we open up the possibility of having a digital prescription sent between doctors, direct to manufacturers, and or even pharmacies. This consortium is to show a proof of concept of how a fully functioning smart supply chain could operate between healthcare providers, manufacturers, pharma companies, and even pharmaceutical machinery.FarmaTrust technology will underpin all of this and created an interoperable but crucially immutable record between stakeholders. Without digital ledger technology, the next staged in digital healthcare and smart medicine supply chains will be unworkable.OSP: Does the group have any short- or long-term goals you would be willing to share?â€‹RS: In the longer term we have very clear goals in that we want to transform how we transmit data and secure medicines in the supply chain â€“ and we are talking right down to the individual patient's dosage. For example, we have developed the technology in the last few years for 3D printed formulations â€“ but we have no way yet to introduce this â€“ and FarmaTrust technology will empower healthcare providers to transmit these individual dosage requirements between doctors and perhaps the pharmacy at which the final formulation is created - while creating an immutable record for the pharma company and healthcare providers.While this will clearly nearly remove the ability for counterfeit medicines to enter the supply chain it also opens up the possibility for real time dosage requirements, individual dosing, personalized medicine, and automated supply chain control and stock management â€“ think a healthcare system that works more like amazon than a desperate compilation of many actors.\"},\n",

              "  'D': 'Depending on the scope and complexity of the research at hand, the items of equipment needed to perform vital tests can be numerous, sizeable, and expensive. The lack of available lab space, investment funds, and even time needed to conduct tests on these advanced machines can make it difficult (if not impossible) for start-up and mid-size operations to get their hands on such machines, and thereby compete with bigger contract research organizations (CROs).Emerald Cloud Labâ€™s novel solution enables even humble-sized scientific operations to make use of high-end laboratory equipment by offering remote access to such advanced gear remotely, for a monthly fee that amounts to less than the cost of investing in a single piece of equipment. Toby Blackburn, ECLâ€™s vice president of business and development, took the time to speak with Outsourcing-Pharma about the advantages the solution offers, and some of the notable organizations that have taken advantage.OSP: Could you please talk about the concept of â€œautomated scienceâ€\\x9d and how researchers are growing to understand and accept it?â€‹TB: Researchers in science are beginning to look around at other industries (tech, manufacturing, distribution, etc.), and the advancements that technology has made in those areas, and are asking themselves why they are still operating labs the same way they did more than two decades ago. The technology required to bring the same efficiencies, cost savings, and process improvement to the lab environment is well developed and proven in other industries.The challenge for the research community has been the degree to which high-skill activities (experimental design, data interpretation, application to molecule/process) have been intertwined with low-skill activities (procurement, inventory management, data recording, sample, and material logistics). The time needed to run a lab is taking time away from research and discovery.Cloud labs create a separation between scientific discovery and laboratory management, allowing your scientific talent to focus on the science. To realize this vision, our software platform uses AI to intelligently suggest experimental parameters based on sample and other associated information, making it easy to ensure that experiments are fully and unambiguously specified from start to finish.Fully proceduralized and defined methods are a by-product resulting from day-to-day research, allowing for directly reproducible experiments without additional effort.Cloud labs also reduce costs by removing the need to construct lab space, purchase equipment, and hire staff. Finally, since the cloud lab runs semi-autonomously at all times day and night, researchers are advancing their experiments much more quickly than if they had to depend on their own collection of instruments.There is a whole host of positive externalities that arise from this \"proceduralization\" â€“ remote execution, the ability to move up a level of abstraction (that is, writing a protocol that automatically generates a method, versus writing a protocol that runs a method), cost efficiencies, increased throughput, model quality data on the output, etc.Functionally, all of Emerald Cloud Labâ€™s value propositions come out of this fundamental desire to fully define science, using the cloud as the interface between the scientist and the lab.Â\\xa0OSP: The ECL is a novel conceptâ€”could you explain how the idea came about? What needs did you and your team see in the industry you felt this solution could address?â€‹TB: Emerald Cloud Lab arose from a need that our co-founders, Brian Frezza and D.J. Kleinbaum, had with theirÂ\\xa0first startup, Emerald Therapeutics. Emerald Therapeutics had a research plan that was much larger than their budget, which necessitated working extremelyÂ\\xa0efficiently. One way they achieved this was to train each scientist to write code so that they could automate aspects of their work whenever possible, thereby multiplying their productivity.Of course, scientists use the results of one experiment to inform the next experiment, and it quickly became apparent that a bottleneck in this environment was the ability to seamlessly share data between scientists and their experiments, so the founders wrote a unified data-sharing platform for the company.Having successfully unified and automated experimental data analysis, they then asked themselves if they could go a step further and automate the generation of that data. To make this a worthwhile endeavor such a system should make it easy to specify and run any method that an Emerald scientist wanted, otherwise the time spent programming the method would exceed the time to just run it by hand, which would defeat the point.Solving this design brief led to the precursor of Emerald Cloud Lab, a unified software environment that allowed scientists to quickly script an experiment and analyze the resulting data. After some time in development, the productivity gains exceeded everyoneâ€™s expectations and the founders and board realized that Emerald Cloud Lab could enable other startups and large companies to similarly leverage their scientific talent in ways not possible before.Â\\xa0OSP: How does it work?â€‹(Image: Emerald Cloud Lab)TB: Itâ€™s easiest to understand how Emerald Cloud Lab works by breaking the process down into four steps: Command, Run, Explore, and Analyze.In the Command phase, clients ship their samples to an ECL facility and design their experiments in the ECL Command Center application. Every detail of every experiment can be designed without any artificial restrictions â\\x81\\xa0â€” itâ€™s the same as being in the laboratory itself.ECL can handle materials as small as microliters and micrograms or as large as liters and kilograms, and experiments span the range of capabilities needed in a modern pharmaceutical company. With ECLâ€™s Command Center software, any experimental parameters can be set or modified with a point-and-click interface â€“ or even by directly typing commands into your lab notebook. Once designed, protocols are automatically saved to a database for push-button reproducibility and higher-level scriptability in larger workflows.In the Run phase, ECL remotely conducts the experiments in a highly automated facility to the scientistâ€™s exact specifications. The lab currently has over 190 different types of instruments online, including HPLC, Mass Spectrometry, and NMR. Once an experiment is submitted through ECL Command Center, it is run automatically. Results are added to the userâ€™s database in just a few days.In the Explore phase, clients can make use of the â€œECL Constellation,â€\\x9d a network of linked database objects that structures data in a highly organized knowledge graph. This graphical database grows automatically over time as more experiments are conducted, containing all data associated with every experiment ever run on the system in an easily searchable format.We really mean all â€‹data here - whether you want to look up the model number of a column used in an experiment, or the lead time on a specific buffer, or the number of minutes a particular sample spent outside of the freezer during testing. Because ECL Constellation lives in the cloud, data is accessible from any computer with a secure login.With ECL Constellation, any questions about experiments can be answered in seconds by surfing through this knowledge graph with a few clicks or keystrokes. Searches can be conducted across the full history of experiments run on the system, including system data like the QC reports that ECL runs regularly on its instrumentation.In the Analyze phase, researchers can use the ECL Command Center for access to an extensive suite of tools to plot, analyze, and visualize results. ECL Command Center offers over 4,500 powerful functions for data visualization, analysis, and simulation.The software also allows experiments, data, analysis, results, and scientific figures to be exported, shared, or published on the web. These tools can be accessed through a point-and-click interface, or the commands can be directly entered into your lab notebook. This makes it easy to repeat or scale any analysis with a single command and to automate report generation through higher-level scripting.OSP: Could you please talk about the benefits users of the cloud lab might gain? Please feel free to talk about anything from time savings, cost savings at various levels, the ability to â€˜borrowâ€™ equipment rather than invest, etc.â€‹TB: Our clientsâ€™ proof of concept results have demonstrated five- to eight-time improvement in individual scientist productivity, resulting from both the reduction in logistical tasks required of scientists as well as increased instrument utilization from the ECL operating 24/7/365. This translates into cost savings and increased throughput.The data that comes out of the cloud lab is more organized and complete than anything on the market. We call this \"model quality data,\" in that it is fully ready for artificial intelligence and machine learning tools without the type of data cleansing required today.The data is also much easier to access. With the traditional model, a glitch in a manufacturing process could mean dozens of scientists searching for, aggregating, and organizing relevant development data sets for weeks, just to be able to start to interpret the data and make informed decisions on what to do next. By contrast, with Emerald Cloud Lab, the same data could be identified and organized in a matter of minutes.For startups, the breadth of equipment available without incurring significant capital costs is a huge driver. Emerald Cloud Lab is based on an annual subscription model, and startups can obtain a full year of access to the system for about the cost of a single piece of laboratory equipment. Clients can scale up their use of the lab without taking on additional expenses--not only in capital but also in human resources.Additionally, clients can get started in days, instead of the many months it would take to find, build out, purchase, install, and run equipment, etc.Â\\xa0OSP: How does the solution differ in what it offers clients compared to on-demand lab space?â€‹TB: First, ECLâ€™s solution is comprehensive; for a single access fee, clients get access to over 190 types of lab instruments (and over 550 individual instruments), full-featured lab notebooks, automated inventory management, and access to a full catalog of reagents, consumables, and other materials. These instruments are always returned to \"ground state\" and routinely monitored with quality control experiments to make sure they are always ready to run a client\\'s experiments.Â\\xa0Overall, with ECL, researchers can run all of their basic experiments exactly as they envisioned without the hassle of maintaining their own laboratory.Furthermore, on-demand lab space still requires capital investment and buildout time â€“ which can be six months or more for lab fitout, instrument acquisition time, and so on. By contrast, a researcher can start experimenting with ECL in days.Even the most well-equipped labs still lack much of the equipment that would be core to biotech/pharma research. Additionally, shared equipment is exactly that â€“ shared. Without the data records and attention to detail in returning an instrument to â€œground stateâ€\\x9d that ECL provides, your confidence in your results can be really shaky if you are always worried about the possibility of an instrument problem.OSP: Could you please talk about some of the use cases and customers the ECL is best suited for? You mentioned small-scale and start-up operations, for example.â€‹Toby Blackburn, VP of business and development, Emerald Cloud LabTB: Emerald Cloud Lab is well-suited to companies of any size that are interested in improving the means by which they approach life science research.Â\\xa0Our use cases range from top 20 biotech companies to fast-growing startup operations to Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Mellon College of Science.Certainly, small-scale and start-up operations can immediately benefit from the cost savings and risk reduction that Emerald Cloud Lab offers. For the cost of a single piece of laboratory equipment, these companies have access to over 190 different types of high-throughput instruments.Emerald Cloud Lab saves startups from having to raise money to purchase and maintain scientific instruments. It enables greater repeatability because all protocols and results are recorded, tracked, and followed automatically. It also frees up crucial time needed for experimental design and data interpretation.Of course, those benefits apply not only to fast-growing start-ups but to larger biotech companies and academic research labs, as well. In fact, one of our highest-profile biotech clients conservatively estimated that their scientists saw productivity improvements of 500-800% with Emerald Cloud Lab over a traditional lab.Â\\xa0Separately, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student was able to replicate four years of dissertation research in two weeks with ECL.OSP: Youâ€™d mentioned some CROs might view the ECL tech and capabilities as a threat to their operationsâ€”could you please talk about that?â€‹TB: Itâ€™s true that some CROs might view Emerald Cloud Lab as competitive to their business. However, these organizations can benefit from the scalability and risk reduction offered by Emerald Cloud Lab in the same way any pharma client might. Access to ECL will enable them to compete with much larger players.On another level, to apply their scientistsâ€™ expertise, CROs have been shunted into the role of equipment operator. We see many synergies in how we are able to leverage the expertise a CRO provides with the highly leveraged operation and advanced data processes that a cloud lab enables. We strive to ensure equipment operates as intended, and experiments are performed as specified.As we discussed, researchers around the world, including people at Carnegie Mellon University, found their work interrupted by the pandemic, being unable to visit their physical lab space. Could you please talk a bit about your collaboration with CMUâ€”how you got to know each other, those early talks, the coursework, etc.?Emerald Cloud Labâ€™s founders, Brian Frezza and D.J. Kleinbaum, are both alumni of Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Mellon College of Science. ECLâ€™s collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University grew out of a desire of the founders to give back to their alma mater â€“ along with a challenge that was issued to the Dean of the College of Science, Rebecca Doerge, when she arrived at CMU some five years ago.At the time, Dean Doerge was given the goal of elevating the reputation of the Mellon College of Science to a status comparable to the universityâ€™s Engineering and IT programs and decided that partnering with ECL was the best way to fulfill this objective.The burgeoning relationship proved its value when COVID-19 forced many colleges to shutter their labs â€“ threatening to derail or delay their research for months or longer. Emerald Cloud Lab donated their time and their cloud lab infrastructure to Mellon College of Science researchers to enable research to continue despite pandemic restrictions.This relationship allowed CMU undergrads an unprecedented opportunity to learn about automated science. Students spent six weeks studying the interactions between small-molecule dyes and proteins, running their experiments in the cloud.This area of research, the modeling of ligand-receptor interactions, is fundamental to many pharmaceutical and biomedical research objectives. It is potentially related to both biotechnology and biofuel advancements as well.Beyond bringing research back to shuttered labs, Dean Doerge sees the advent of cloud labs as the future of scientific research. To that end, Carnegie Mellon is making a $40m [USD] investment in the college to construct their own version of Emerald Cloud Labâ€™s facility as the linchpin of a multi-year strategic initiative.OSP: Carnegie Mellon professor Marcel Bruchez has said that this technology stands to make science more â€œinclusive.â€\\x9d Could you talk about how that works, and why thatâ€™s a brilliant thing?â€‹TB: The notion of inclusivity and democratization is at the core of what makes cloud labs in general â€“ and Emerald Cloud Lab in particular â€“ such an important development in life science research. Promising scientific minds will no longer be constrained by the realities of laboratory access, where only the largest, best-funded organizations in the wealthiest countries can make important, sometimes life-changing discoveries, and scientists must be physically present to play a role.The cloud lab enables biotech start-ups to get up and running at a fraction of the cost of what it may have taken only a few years ago. With Emerald Cloud Lab in particular, more than 40 types of important biotech experiments can be conducted while the scientists are sitting in front of their computer â€“ wherever that computer may be. Automation eliminates unintentional bias, and reproducibility allows scientists to collaborate and cooperate across the vast expanse of the globe.This inclusivity and democratization will undoubtedly lead to greater scientific advancements faster, as the concept gains in popularity among more companies and universities around the world.OSP: Could you tell us about ECLâ€™s expansion plans, both what youâ€™ve got on deck and your long-term goals to grow?â€‹TB: ECL continues to expand its suite of scientific instruments and scale our total operational capacity. When we started the company nine years ago, we made a list of every instrument and capability we wanted to include in the lab, and we are about 85% there. Along the way, weâ€™ve invested heavily in scalability and weâ€™re well-positioned to grow our footprint to meet customer demand in the coming years.Also, we are excited to see Carnegie Mellonâ€™s cloud lab open up in the next year, which will enable their students around the world to learn about automated science and their professors to produce groundbreaking research that will elevate Carnegie Mellonâ€™s College of Science and advance life science research for the world. We believe that this is a seminal moment in the adoption of cloud lab technologies across academia and will further accelerate the adoption of cloud labs in the industry.'},\n",

(PRWEB)\\nSeptember 16, 2021\\n Aperture Cellars (http://www.aperture-cellars.com), the record setting Sonoma wine label founded by renowned winemaker Jesse Katz, is excited to announce its acquisition of Farrow Ranch in the hills of Alexander Valley. The deal was closed by Aperture Cellars on September 2nd, 2021. Farrow Ranch has since 2012 produced the fruit for Katzâ€™s Devil Proof Malbecâ€”with critic Jeb Dunnuck giving the Devil Proof 2018 Farrow Ranch Malbec a record setting 100-points and calling it â€œthe finest Malbec Iâ€™ve ever tasted,â€\\x9d and Erin Brooks of Robert Parkerâ€™s The Wine Advocate labeling the wine â€œthe best example of 100% Malbec Iâ€™ve ever tasted,â€\\x9d offering a commensurate 100-point score.\\nOne of the most distinguished vineyard sites in Northern California, Farrow Ranch is a widely-admired legacy property that has been under family ownership, Carol Farrow, for more than three decades. Totaling over seventy-five acres of premium Bordeaux varietals, the blue chip acquisitionâ€”long a sought-after source of nuanced, ultra-premium fruit for producers in the broader Sonoma regionâ€”brings Apertureâ€™s total estate holdings to over 120 acres. Aperture will retain the services of Munselle Vineyard Management, who have been farming the hillside site for the last 7 years. Both renowned viticulture specialist Phil Freese and Jesse Katz will continue working together and focusing attention on the details of farming and cultivation at Farrow Ranch.\\nâ€œI am thrilled to share the news of this exciting acquisition, which expands Apertureâ€™s portfolio considerably and marks an important evolution in the history of our estate,â€\\x9d says Jesse Katz. â€œThe first 100-point vineyard in Alexander Valley history, Farrow Ranch is considered a classic source of some of Californiaâ€™s finest fruitâ€”simply put, the grapes grown here are some of the best in the world. Iâ€™ve been working with Farrow Ranch fruit since 2010 with my critically acclaimed Devil Proof Malbecs, and Iâ€™m excited to officially bring this unique site into Apertureâ€™s estate holdings.â€\\x9d \\nAperture plans to make a single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon from Farrow Ranchâ€™s hillside blocks moving forward, expanding the estateâ€™s site-specific series of wines with a new expression of Sonomaâ€™s terroir. â€œIâ€™ve had the great fortune to work with multiple 100 Point Sites throughout my career around the world, and Farrow Ranch is one of the greatest sites Iâ€™ve ever worked with. There is no doubt in my mind that this site has the ability of producing a 100-point Cabernet Sauvignon as well,â€\\x9d notes Jesse. \\nWhere the Alexander Valley benchlands reach the Mayacamas coastal range, Farrow Ranch lays claim to complex volcanic soils and a warm, breezy, sun-drenched terroir enjoying an April-through-October growing season. Surrounding steep hillsides help to accentuate frequent diurnal temperature shifts of forty degrees, with the Pacific's marine influence sending cool, restorative moisture in from the coast in the evenings. \\nAbout Aperture Cellars: Aperture Cellars (http://www.aperture-cellars.com) champions a range of stunning Bordeaux style wines from the Sonoma Valley. Founded in 2009 by winemaker Jesse Katz, Aperture wines are crafted from unique, cool-climate vineyards in Sonomaâ€™s top regions. Aperture controls 210+ acres of vineyards, in addition to their 32 planted acres on the winery site, specifically sourced for their unique terroir and soil composition. Wanting to craft wines on par with the quality and refinement that are so integral to a Bordeaux, Jesse set roots in Sonoma, believing it offers the best of both worlds: new world fruit and old-world elegance.\\n\"},\n",

This is truly both ground and sky-breaking technology!\" said Barry Alexander, Founder and Chairman of Aquiline Drones.\\n\\n\\nHARTFORD, Conn. (PRWEB)\\nSeptember 15, 2021\\n Apple and Siri. Amazon and Alexa. Microsoft and Cortana. Aquiline Drones and Spartacus. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained increasing popularity across industries.  Worldwide revenues for the AI market, including software, hardware, and services, are forecast to grow 40.2% annually, topping $997.77 billion by the end of 2028, according to a latest report by Grand View Research, an international consulting firm that helps Fortune 500 companies understand the global and regional business environment. (Artificial Intelligence Market Size Analysis Report, 2021-2028 (grandviewresearch.com)\\nEarlier today, Connecticut-based Aquiline Drones Corporation (AD) announced the acquisition of ElluminAI Labs, LLC to support further development of its AI framework called Spartacus.  This is ADâ€™s second strategic acquisition in the companyâ€™s pre-IPO plan. It was just last month that AD completed the purchase of 50% of Netherlands-based AerialTronics, a renowned drone manufacturer, for $9.0M USD from Paris-based Drone Volt (ALDRV).  This was principally to bolster ADâ€™s in-house R&D capabilities.  Drone Volt is a publicly traded French drone manufacturer and leader in AI technology with which AD has a strong, equity-based partnership.   \\nThis AI acquisition enables AD to deliver superior deep learning AI frameworks throughout its entire drone technology ecosystem which includes drone pilot training, drone manufacturing, commercial drone operations and cloud solutions on a global scale.  \\nADâ€™s Spartacus AI is modular, with different sets of services and proficiencies. It can learn specialized skills on a case-by-case basis, while offering broad integration ability across various environments.  The AI will deliver key capabilities across ADâ€™s continuum of drone and cloud-based services, including: \\n\\n\\n\\n  A cognitive assistant for the online ground training experience. The Spartacus deep learning assistant is being integrated into all Flight-to-the-Future programs (http://www.FlighttotheFuture.com) where it will answer questions and intervene with precise suggestions based on how students interact with the course curriculum. Flight to the Future is ADâ€™s nationally acclaimed and complete drone pilot training program currently being attended by police officers, firefighters and other first responders nationwide.\\n Spartacus contains a â€˜Natural Language Processingâ€™ (NLP) engine that enables voice recognition and voice command and acts as an AI assistant across ADâ€™s drone technology ecosystem. \\n Spartacus is equipped with Machine Vision (MV) skills to analyze drone data in real-time. The data analysis is highly specialized by use case and the Spartacus AI can master each application. For example, AD is currently working with a prominent commercial orchard to release specialized AI packages for data analysis which include applications as diverse as fruit counting, fruit analysis, etc. Other AI applications include the deciphering of thermal images from firefighting drones â€“ a specialized AI application currently being taught via ADâ€™s Flight to the Future program with immediate real-world applications thereafter!  \\n Spartacus plays a crucial role in ADâ€™s industry-leading robotic solutions for inspection, public safety and future UAV delivery services. For example, it will be part of ADâ€™s Command and Control (AD C2) framework, optimizing flight planning and execution. It is also used for dynamic scheduling and flight dispatching of fully autonomous solutions.\\n Most significantly, the Deep Learning framework behind Spartacus allows for Big Data analysis. As experience is gained, Spartacus has the potential to master multiple knowledge spheres, discerning hidden patterns within the aggregated data. This has significant implications for future machine operations and positions the AD Cloud as an industry transformer for commercial drone operations.\\nâ€œIt is a true pleasure and exciting time to join Aquiline Drones; one of the most innovative and cutting-edge companies on our planet,â€\\x9d said Dr. Scott Martin, co-founder of ElluminAI Labs and professor at George Mason University. â€œJoining AD to build the next-gen AI solutions together to advance the global drone, aviation and training markets is indeed transformative, and we canâ€™t wait to help launch tomorrowâ€™s groundbreaking AI driven societies.â€\\x9d \\nâ€œOur acquisition of ElluminAI will produce a powerful system that delivers a modular, deep learning cognitive framework, capable of flight optimization, training assistance and data analysis for the most sophisticated business processes involving commercial drones to essentially improve a companyâ€™s profitability.  This is not only ground-breaking technology, but sky-breaking technology as well!â€\\x9d said Barry Alexander, founder and chairman of Aquiline Drones. â€œWhatâ€™s more is the superior and scientific architecture that ElluminAI brings to the table that will monitor and manage the AD ecosystem more accurately, skillfully and successfully.â€\\x9d\\nAlexander notes that a main difference between Spartacus and other digital agents is its advanced architecture, based on artificial neural networks, which provide the ability to get smarter and more efficient over time, especially with increasing amounts of data. \\nâ€œUnlike traditional machine learning, Spartacusâ€™ deep learning doesnâ€™t reach a point of diminishing returns as data gets more complex,â€\\x9d adds Alexander.  â€œIn fact, Spartacus becomes smarter with experience as individual skills are created for different use cases and conditions. This is precisely what is needed to handle real-world conditions.â€\\x9d\\nSpartacus is a complete AI framework. Although initially focused on drone data analysis, drone operations, flight management and the like, it has wider applications beyond drones.\\nAs a powerful AI framework that is easy to integrate across environments, Spartacus can seamlessly and simultaneously traverse activities at work and in the home; especially while traveling. Such activities include managing home security, energy usage, vehicle maintenance, personal schedules, and other connected devices, while offering options for anticipated activities based on â€˜habit recognitionâ€™. \\nSimilarly, Spartacus can be enhanced for different IoT (Internet of Things) settings, such as factory management, logistics, construction site surveillance, precision farming, facility management and maintenance advisor â€“ to name a few. Each role requires building the right set of skills beforehand. With both drones and IoT devices becoming increasingly popular in such environments, Spartacus brings capabilities to the table that just cannot be ignored.\\nAlexander highlights the role of Spartacus in the handling of UAV traffic across the National Airspace System (NAS) through ADâ€™s Command and Control (C2) capability on the AD Cloud. Here, Spartacus gathers data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other official sources, combines it with weather and additional external information, to provide crucial, real-time notifications and advisories to operation planners and drone pilots before and during the mission. \\nThis full life-cycle support includes a comprehensive set of functions that optimize flight safety and provide skills beyond standard UAV requirements. The result is the delivery of real-time data insights from AD Cloud connected drones to AD C2, so business owners, UAV operators and operation planners have greater control of their activities.\\nIn fact, Forbes recently featured AD in its coverage of AI:\\n\\nWhatâ€™s next for this comprehensive cognitive digital agent?  Alexander shares that Spartacus will be used as the primary interface for ADâ€™s innovative, drone-on-demand service, which will allow customers to pre-order drone services via a mobile app installed on smart phones and other hand-held devices later this year.  Special features of the new technology will include Interactive Voice Command (IVC).\\nâ€œFrom intuitive instructor and mission guide to personal assistant and business coach, Spartacus is the perfect amalgamation of both AD and ElluminAI Labs, offering maximum versatility, reliability, innovation and safety for all UAV solutions,â€\\x9d concludes Alexander. â€œWe are now poised to usher in paradigm-shifting and disruptive technology by providing a full lifecycle approach to all drone industry missions capable of helping businesses and individuals around the world.â€\\x9d\\nAbout Aquiline Drones\\n\\nAquiline Drones (AD) is an American drone manufacturer and cloud solutions company located in the financial district of Hartford, Connecticut.

This is truly both ground and sky-breaking technology!\" said Barry Alexander, Founder and Chairman of Aquiline Drones.\\n\\n\\nHARTFORD, Conn. (PRWEB)\\nSeptember 15, 2021\\n Apple and Siri. Amazon and Alexa. Microsoft and Cortana. Aquiline Drones and Spartacus. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained increasing popularity across industries.  Worldwide revenues for the AI market, including software, hardware, and services, are forecast to grow 40.2% annually, topping $997.77 billion by the end of 2028, according to a latest report by Grand View Research, an international consulting firm that helps Fortune 500 companies understand the global and regional business environment. (Artificial Intelligence Market Size Analysis Report, 2021-2028 (grandviewresearch.com)\\nEarlier today, Connecticut-based Aquiline Drones Corporation (AD) announced the acquisition of ElluminAI Labs, LLC to support further development of its AI framework called Spartacus.  This is ADâ€™s second strategic acquisition in the companyâ€™s pre-IPO plan. It was just last month that AD completed the purchase of 50% of Netherlands-based AerialTronics, a renowned drone manufacturer, for $9.0M USD from Paris-based Drone Volt (ALDRV).  This was principally to bolster ADâ€™s in-house R&D capabilities.  Drone Volt is a publicly traded French drone manufacturer and leader in AI technology with which AD has a strong, equity-based partnership.   \\nThis AI acquisition enables AD to deliver superior deep learning AI frameworks throughout its entire drone technology ecosystem which includes drone pilot training, drone manufacturing, commercial drone operations and cloud solutions on a global scale.  \\nADâ€™s Spartacus AI is modular, with different sets of services and proficiencies. It can learn specialized skills on a case-by-case basis, while offering broad integration ability across various environments.  The AI will deliver key capabilities across ADâ€™s continuum of drone and cloud-based services, including: \\n\\n\\n\\n  A cognitive assistant for the online ground training experience. The Spartacus deep learning assistant is being integrated into all Flight-to-the-Future programs (http://www.FlighttotheFuture.com) where it will answer questions and intervene with precise suggestions based on how students interact with the course curriculum. Flight to the Future is ADâ€™s nationally acclaimed and complete drone pilot training program currently being attended by police officers, firefighters and other first responders nationwide.\\n Spartacus contains a â€˜Natural Language Processingâ€™ (NLP) engine that enables voice recognition and voice command and acts as an AI assistant across ADâ€™s drone technology ecosystem. \\n Spartacus is equipped with Machine Vision (MV) skills to analyze drone data in real-time. The data analysis is highly specialized by use case and the Spartacus AI can master each application. For example, AD is currently working with a prominent commercial orchard to release specialized AI packages for data analysis which include applications as diverse as fruit counting, fruit analysis, etc. Other AI applications include the deciphering of thermal images from firefighting drones â€“ a specialized AI application currently being taught via ADâ€™s Flight to the Future program with immediate real-world applications thereafter!  \\n Spartacus plays a crucial role in ADâ€™s industry-leading robotic solutions for inspection, public safety and future UAV delivery services. For example, it will be part of ADâ€™s Command and Control (AD C2) framework, optimizing flight planning and execution. It is also used for dynamic scheduling and flight dispatching of fully autonomous solutions.\\n Most significantly, the Deep Learning framework behind Spartacus allows for Big Data analysis. As experience is gained, Spartacus has the potential to master multiple knowledge spheres, discerning hidden patterns within the aggregated data. This has significant implications for future machine operations and positions the AD Cloud as an industry transformer for commercial drone operations.\\nâ€œIt is a true pleasure and exciting time to join Aquiline Drones; one of the most innovative and cutting-edge companies on our planet,â€\\x9d said Dr. Scott Martin, co-founder of ElluminAI Labs and professor at George Mason University. â€œJoining AD to build the next-gen AI solutions together to advance the global drone, aviation and training markets is indeed transformative, and we canâ€™t wait to help launch tomorrowâ€™s groundbreaking AI driven societies.â€\\x9d \\nâ€œOur acquisition of ElluminAI will produce a powerful system that delivers a modular, deep learning cognitive framework, capable of flight optimization, training assistance and data analysis for the most sophisticated business processes involving commercial drones to essentially improve a companyâ€™s profitability.  This is not only ground-breaking technology, but sky-breaking technology as well!â€\\x9d said Barry Alexander, founder and chairman of Aquiline Drones. â€œWhatâ€™s more is the superior and scientific architecture that ElluminAI brings to the table that will monitor and manage the AD ecosystem more accurately, skillfully and successfully.â€\\x9d\\nAlexander notes that a main difference between Spartacus and other digital agents is its advanced architecture, based on artificial neural networks, which provide the ability to get smarter and more efficient over time, especially with increasing amounts of data. \\nâ€œUnlike traditional machine learning, Spartacusâ€™ deep learning doesnâ€™t reach a point of diminishing returns as data gets more complex,â€\\x9d adds Alexander.  â€œIn fact, Spartacus becomes smarter with experience as individual skills are created for different use cases and conditions. This is precisely what is needed to handle real-world conditions.â€\\x9d\\nSpartacus is a complete AI framework. Although initially focused on drone data analysis, drone operations, flight management and the like, it has wider applications beyond drones.\\nAs a powerful AI framework that is easy to integrate across environments, Spartacus can seamlessly and simultaneously traverse activities at work and in the home; especially while traveling. Such activities include managing home security, energy usage, vehicle maintenance, personal schedules, and other connected devices, while offering options for anticipated activities based on â€˜habit recognitionâ€™. \\nSimilarly, Spartacus can be enhanced for different IoT (Internet of Things) settings, such as factory management, logistics, construction site surveillance, precision farming, facility management and maintenance advisor â€“ to name a few. Each role requires building the right set of skills beforehand. With both drones and IoT devices becoming increasingly popular in such environments, Spartacus brings capabilities to the table that just cannot be ignored.\\nAlexander highlights the role of Spartacus in the handling of UAV traffic across the National Airspace System (NAS) through ADâ€™s Command and Control (C2) capability on the AD Cloud. Here, Spartacus gathers data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other official sources, combines it with weather and additional external information, to provide crucial, real-time notifications and advisories to operation planners and drone pilots before and during the mission. \\nThis full life-cycle support includes a comprehensive set of functions that optimize flight safety and provide skills beyond standard UAV requirements. The result is the delivery of real-time data insights from AD Cloud connected drones to AD C2, so business owners, UAV operators and operation planners have greater control of their activities.\\nIn fact, Forbes recently featured AD in its coverage of AI:\\n\\nWhatâ€™s next for this comprehensive cognitive digital agent?  Alexander shares that Spartacus will be used as the primary interface for ADâ€™s innovative, drone-on-demand service, which will allow customers to pre-order drone services via a mobile app installed on smart phones and other hand-held devices later this year.  Special features of the new technology will include Interactive Voice Command (IVC).\\nâ€œFrom intuitive instructor and mission guide to personal assistant and business coach, Spartacus is the perfect amalgamation of both AD and ElluminAI Labs, offering maximum versatility, reliability, innovation and safety for all UAV solutions,â€\\x9d concludes Alexander. â€œWe are now poised to usher in paradigm-shifting and disruptive technology by providing a full lifecycle approach to all drone industry missions capable of helping businesses and individuals around the world.â€\\x9d\\nAbout Aquiline Drones\\n\\nAquiline Drones (AD) is an American drone manufacturer and cloud solutions company located in the financial district of Hartford, Connecticut.

The Mayflower Retirement Center, Inc. (the â€œObligorâ€\\x9d) is a Florida not-for-profit corporation formed in 1973. The Obligor owns and operates Mayflower Retirement Community (the â€œCommunityâ€\\x9d), a â€œType Aâ€\\x9d life plan community in Winter Park, Florida located approximately six miles from the downtown area of Orlando. The Community opened in 1989 is situated on approximately 37 acres and currently consists of 220 independent living apartments and 28 villas, 31 private assisted living units with 15 used for memory support services, 60 nursing beds and associated common areas. The Community is regulated pursuant to Chapter 651, Florida Statutes.\\nThe Obligor is pursuing a two-phase repositioning of its campus. Phase I was financed in November of 2020 with the issuance of the Series 2020A Bonds in the amount of $60,135,000. Phase I of the expansion project consists of the construction of a new health care center comprised of 24 private memory care suites and 60 private skilled nursing rooms. Phase II of the expansion project is being financed with the issuance of the Series 2021 Bonds. Phase II consists of the construction of 50 new independent living units, a clubhouse that will provide dining and social spaces, and the renovation of existing space currently used to house the skilled nursing beds into 21 assisted living units. Both the Series 2020A Bonds and the Series 2021 Bonds are rated BB+ (stable) by Fitch Ratings. Sawgrass Partners, LLC, is serving as the development consultant for the repositioning.\\nSteve Kramer, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Obligor stated, â€œRich Scanlon and the entire Ziegler team did an excellent job securing the financing for our new Bristol Landing expansion. Their commitment and expertise led to outstanding results, which greatly benefit our project. The Mayflower at Winter Park board and management are thrilled with the outcome and are looking forward to further enhancing the services provided to our residents and the greater Winter Park community.â€\\x9d\\nRich Scanlon, Senior Managing Director, Senior Living Finance at Ziegler stated, â€œThe Mayflower opened in 1989 and has long been recognized as one of the leading senior living communities in the Orlando market area. As the community surpassed 25 years of age, the Board recognized that its physical plant was lagging that of market demands and a major repositioning was long overdue. In 2015, Steve Kramer was brought in as the CEO and set in motion the repositioning process by selling surplus land away from the community and purchasing land that was adjacent. This was a great strategic move and, although the acquired land would require nearly $12 million in site development costs, provided Mayflower with the opportunity to significantly upgrade the quality of offerings to current and future residents for years to come.â€\\x9d\\nZiegler is the nationâ€™s leading underwriter of financing for not-for-profit senior living providers.

Mitigating potential security risks before they even happen is key to both offerings.\\n\\n\\nTAMPA, Fla. (PRWEB)\\nAugust 31, 2021\\n Password Boss, an enterprise-class password manager solution provider for managed service providers (MSPs), announced today that it has acquired AutoElevate, a provider of automated privileged access management (PAM) software. The acquisition will bring together two best-in-class security solutions, giving MSPs the ability to better drive security for their own and their clientsâ€™ organizations. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\\nâ€œWhen our group took the reins of Password Boss in 2020, one of our goals was to expand our ability to better support MSP security in an ecosystem thatâ€™s increasingly under attack from cybercriminals and other bad actors,â€\\x9d said David Bellini, CEO of Password Boss. â€œAutoElevate is the perfect fit for two key reasons. One is that its endpoint privilege and automated PAM capabilities nicely complement our password management solution. Mitigating potential security risks before they even happen is key to both offerings. The second reason stems from the deep roots that both our team members have in the MSP community. We are all committed to expanding opportunities for MSPs and helping them realize their long-term business goals. I canâ€™t wait to see what we can do together.â€\\x9d\\nBellini and Todd Jones, co-founder of AutoElevate, have a combined 50+ years of MSP industry experience. In addition to his role as CEO of Password Boss, Bellini is a founder and CFO of ConnectOn, a Tampa Bay area provider of managed services, cloud services and security services. In 1982, he co-founded ConnectWise, a technology solutions provider for MSPs that was acquired by Thoma Bravo in 2019. The investor group that acquired Password Boss in 2020 includes Bellini, Drew McCallum and Adam Slutskin. Jones, who began his career in the managed services industry more than 20 years ago, founded a security-centric MSP practice in Colorado before it was acquired 2016. In 2018, he launched Miami-based AutoElevate to fulfill the need he saw for an MSP-based solution for privilege management. \\nBellini will serve as CEO of both organizations. Jones will remain with AutoElevate to manage operations and ongoing technology initiatives. \\nJones said that, like Bellini, he too is excited about what the two companies can do together in leveraging their unified mindset for an expanded MSP cybersecurity solution. â€œI saw early in my career that removing local administrative rights and employing endpoint privilege management immediately enhances an MSPâ€™s cybersecurity efforts and serves as one of the best ways to help stop malware and thwart attackers,â€\\x9d Jones said. â€œAt AutoElevate, we took that concept and then added a layer of automation that simplifies the management for MSPs. When any MSP takes advantage of the capabilities of our PAM software in combination with Password Bossâ€™ industry-leading password protection solution, that MSP is well on its way to building a strong perimeter defense against anyone who attempts to leverage it as a gateway to customer computers.â€\\x9d\\nPassword Boss, a complete end-to-end password management solution for MSPs, was designed and developed in 2014 specifically for the needs and the ways that todayâ€™s MSPs work and support their customersâ€™ password management needs. It provides a multi-tenant management portal that centralizes password management, automatic deployments through an MSPâ€™s remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, synchronization across devices, multiple layers of enterprise-grade security, dark web scans, and more.\\nAutoElevate adopts the principle of â€œleast privilegeâ€\\x9d for end user workstations for MSPs across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Administrative privileges are automatically elevated only when required to run approved and trusted applications. This limits the opportunity for an attacker to compromise an entire network by targeting privileged account passwords. Like Password Boss, AutoElevate leverages a multi-tenant central management portal and is easily deployed to allow MSPs to take control of use of privilege across their clients.  \\nBoth Password Boss and AutoElevate seamlessly integrate with a number of PSA, RMM and remote access tools, including those from Connectwise, Autotask and Kaseya. \\nA webinar focused on the recent Password Boss acquisition of AutoElevate and how it will increase the levels of cybersecurity protection for the MSP community is scheduled for Sept. 3 at 2 p.m. Eastern time.

The property is a high-performing Class-B 344-unit multifamily property in the metropolis of the strong performing Atlanta market. The property was bought in partnership with Blue Lake Capital, LLC, led by CEO Ellie Perlman. This powerhouse duo combined forces to successfully spearhead this acquisition via REV Fund - a joint-led $100M multifamily value-add fund established in May 2021.\\nThe property, located at 2620 N Berkeley Lake Road NW, Duluth, GA 30096, is a 2002 institutional-quality asset that enjoys an exceptional location and a promising interior renovation opportunity. In addition, the property also offers a robust amenity package including a resort-style swimming pool, large sundeck with a grilling area, fitness center, dog park, tennis courts, playgrounds, sprawling nature trails, and detached garages.\\nThe property will be enhanced via a value-add strategy, which entails installing modern apartment unit finishes such as stainless-steel appliances, vinyl plank flooring, new lighting and hardware, new backsplashes, and other features to further drive the desirable tenant base currently in place. Coupled with additional income-generating improvements, Vive Funds is confident in delivering a strongly performing and profitable asset to investors.\\nThis most recent acquisition marks further continued growth for Veena Jettiâ€™s portfolio and takes her portfolio to just over $500MM in AUM throughout the Texas, Florida, and Georgia markets.

By implementing expert hands-on strategies to lower costs and maximize collections, the company has recently pushed rents up by 23.65% on some units, well above proforma projections.\\nA defining factor in this strategy is founded in utilizing machine learning/artificial intelligence throughout the course of all acquisitions and asset management. This advanced technology enables the company to produce accurate and data-driven forecasting for all assets on a market, property, and even tenant basis. In doing so, Vive Funds is able to lead commercial investments with the full capabilities of todayâ€™s technology.\\nThe deal included several strong working partnerships, including the lending team, led by Melissa Marcolini Quinn, who is assisted by Lee Weaver, and Rob Rothaug, who all recently joined JLL. Large private funds and family offices are bullish on the sponsors and invested significantly into the deal. The SEC attorney, Nic McGrue of Polymath Legal, also played a crucial role in the deal structure.

We use the latest data from Australiaâ€™s Foreign Investment Review Board (â€œFIRBâ€\\x9d) to illuminate the change and its implications. \\nDuring the two years between June 2018 and July 2020, Australiaâ€™s Foreign Investment Review Board approved Singaporean investors to acquire AU$19.3 billion of Australian real estate, while Chinese entities received approval for just AU$13.2 billion of such investment. The gap in Singaporeâ€™s favour was AU$6.1 billion.\\nSingaporeâ€™s approved Australian real estate investment only first reached $5 billion in 2016-17. It quickly jumped to AU$8 billion the following year and then rose to more than AU$9 billion in the two most recent years, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Today, at 17%, it accounts for a larger share of the total than at any other time on record.\\nOn the contrary, Chinaâ€™s share of annual investment in Australian real estate ballooned between 2012 and 2018. Today, however, Chinese investment has fallen even as Singapore investment has climbed. China accounted for 26% of foreign real estate investment in Australia in 2015â€“16. Today, at 13% of the total, Chinaâ€™s share is still significant but below its recent peaks.\\nThe makeup of the two countriesâ€™ investment flows are different. \\nSingaporean investment is weighted towards large-scale investors purchasing commercial property and development sites. Chinese investment is now predominantly individual buyers purchasing residential units.\\nExamples of Singaporean investors include Singaporeâ€™s sovereign wealth fund GIC, Singapore Press Holdings, and listed Singaporean developers Wing Tai and Wee Hur â€” all of which acquired significant Australian assets in 2019-2020.\\nAcross all industries, and not just in real estate, Singapore is the third-largest source of proposed investment in Australia by value in 2019â€“20. It follows the United States and Japan and leads Canada and the United Kingdom. China is sixth.\\nOver the past decade or so, China is still by far the largest investor in aggregate. Chinese approved investments total about AU$126 billion since 2009-10. Thatâ€™s more than double the AU$56 billion invested by Singaporeans during the same time.\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK (PRWEB)\\nAugust 24, 2021\\n Ramp, the first corporate card designed to help businesses spend less, today announced $300M in Series C venture funding at a $3.9B valuation. Founders Fund led the round, with participation from Redpoint Ventures, Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Spark Capital, Coatue Management, Iconiq, Altimeter, Stripe, Lux Capital, A* Partners, Definition Capital, Honeycomb, Kinetic, and other existing investors. Ramp has raised over $620M to date in a mix of equity and debt financing. \\nOver 2,000 US businesses are now using Ramp as their primary spend management solution leading to a tripling of transaction volume on Ramp corporate cards since the companyâ€™s $115 million Series B announced in April 2021, which valued the company at $1.6 billion. \\nRamp intends to use the new financing to accelerate development of its finance automation platform, designed to help businesses save time and money. On average customers save 3.3% annually by switching their corporate card spending to Ramp. Finance teams who use Ramp are able to account for and record all their business expenses at month end in just over 2 hours in most cases, representing a 90% reduction in time. \\nâ€œItâ€™s rare to find a company like Ramp whose growth is actually accelerating as they scale. Rampâ€™s vision of helping businesses spend less is clearly resonating with customers, so we are delighted to be leading this round,â€\\x9d said Keith Rabois, Partner, Founders Fund. â€œThe upside for Ramp is huge given the rapidly growing B2B payments opportunity and the ongoing consolidation of financial software in the enterprise.â€\\x9d\\nAlready the fastest growing US corporate card ever, Ramp has continued to grow rapidly this year with the number of cardholders on the platform increasing 5x since Jan 1. Growth has been driven by Rampâ€™s superior software and user experienceâ€”it has an industry-leading customer satisfaction score (CSAT) of over 95 and is rated Easiest to Use on G2.com in both expense management and spend management categories. \\nâ€œWe founded Ramp with the intent to empower businesses. Rampâ€™s mission is to save our customers time and money so they can focus on their mission,â€\\x9d said Eric Glyman, co-founder & CEO, Ramp. â€œFrankly the current state of finance tools and legacy card programs is not acceptable. They trap finance teams into doing unproductive â€˜busy workâ€™.  This funding will allow us to automate away even more of those tasks so that finance teams can focus on being more strategic.â€\\x9d \\nTo deliver that vision even faster, today Ramp is announcing the acquisition of Buyer. Buyer is the first negotiation-as-a-service platform that saves its clients an average of 27.3% on big ticket purchases such as annual software contracts. With the addition of the Buyer team, Ramp will be able to offer a customized and proactive approach to savings on large purchases, which goes beyond the generic perks and discounts that most corporate cards offer today. \\nIn the longer term Ramp also intends to expand its product offering as a result of the Buyer acquisition. By combining Buyerâ€™s team with benchmarking spend data from millions of transactions on its platform, Ramp wants to help its customers negotiate the best rate on anything that can be purchased with a cardâ€”from travel to softwareâ€”with the goal of shifting purchasing power back into the hands of buyers. \\nâ€œOver the course of the pandemic software spending ballooned. It is now the second largest line item for companies. By finding better value on these purchases, weâ€™ve been able to have a meaningful impact on the bottom line for many businesses,â€\\x9d said Kimia Hamidi, Founder and CEO of Buyer. â€œWe couldnâ€™t be more excited about joining the Ramp team, because both of our companies care deeply about helping our customers achieve more through savings. Joining Ramp will allow us to scale this vision.â€\\x9d \\nProving that business savings are a universal value proposition Ramp has attracted some of the fastest growing startups and unicorns like Ro, DoNotPay, Better, ClickUp, and Applied Intuition, in addition to established businesses across the US including Bristol Hospice, Walther Farms, Douglas Elliman, and Planned Parenthood. \\nAbout Ramp:\\n\\nRamp (http://www.ramp.com) is the worldâ€™s first finance automation platform. With Ramp, businesses get corporate cards and payments with built-in expense and accounting automation software â€” all in one free and simple solution. \\nUnlike legacy financial service providers, Ramp designs its products to help companies spend less. Customers save an average of 3.3% by switching their spending to the Ramp platform and are closing their books 5 days earlier each month. Founded in March 2019, Ramp is Americaâ€™s #1 rated and fastest-growing corporate card.\\n'},\n",

In addition, the strategic partner will assist FastWave Medical in accelerating global expansion by bringing its cutting-edge technology to China. \\nâ€œCurrent interventional approaches for atherosclerosis can be anatomically limited, procedurally complex, or result in complications such as dissection, perforation, or embolization.

There is a significant need for advanced endovascular technologies that can effectively treat calcified disease in a procedurally efficient manner without unintended patient complications.\\nâ€œWe are extremely pleased to see FastWave close this round of financing.

              "  'D': \"\\n\\nISELIN, N.J. (PRWEB)\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n Itâ€™s been a busy 2021 for Lightbridge AcademyÂ®, one of the nationâ€™s leading providers of early education and child care. In addition to opening its 60th center in July, the rapidly expanding franchise brand is on track to open 22 new units in the next 15 months.  \\nCurrently, Lightbridge Academy has more than 120 centers open, under construction or in development in markets across the U.S. The franchise announced plans to expand its system from 60 to more than 150 centers by 2026. \\nA Year of Franchise Growth\\nThe brand opened six units this year, with new centers in NYC, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. By the end of 2021, Lightbridge Academy plans to have another six open. Three of the new units are owned by current franchisees who were looking to deepen their investment in the brand. \\nThe expansion comes despite the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic placed in front of the education sector last year. Lightbridge Academy more than maintained its growth momentum; its Holly Springs, North Carolina center opened in September with record-breaking enrollment numbers for the brand, followed by an Apex, North Carolina center that opened within six months of the Holly Springs location.\\nâ€œI am incredibly proud of what Lightbridge Academy has achieved over the course of this year and last,â€\\x9d said Gigi Schweikert, CEO. â€œFacing unprecedented challenges that directly impacted the way child care is delivered, our company was able to continue opening new centers and attracting new franchise partners.â€\\x9d\\nA New Investment Partner Spurs New Growth Goals\\nThe fuel for this accelerated growth plan is an infusion of capital from investment partners Westerly Group (Westerly) & Elmsley Capital (Elmsley). Unlike traditional private equity investors, who invest from funds with limited holding periods, Westerly & Elmsley invest on behalf of a small handful of families without a requirement to sell. \\nThis permanent capital makes them the ideal partners for Lightbridge Academy, whose core commitment to providing a high quality of care and early education in a safe and trusted environment has played a critical role in the lives of thousands of families for the past 24 years. This shift will combine Lightbridge Franchise Company with Jule Holdings, the owner of the corporately operated child care centers, under a new company â€“ Lightbridge Holdings Group.\\nAn Increasing Commitment To Operational Excellence\\nIn addition to growing its number of units, Lightbridge Academy has continued to invest in franchisee support. This year, it launched Lightbridge JourneyÂ®, a new center management software, that provides a 360-degree, centralized place for franchisees, providing increased operational efficiency, reduced operational costs and ultimately improved communication between staff and parents. \\nDuring the initial rollout of Lightbridge Journey, the platform proved its value: It saved 28 centers approximately 336 hours of time over 9 months, providing them almost an entire day per week to spend on relationship building with center families.\\nâ€œIt truly has been a year filled with incredible achievements for our brand,â€\\x9d said Joanne Sofia, chief operating officer of the brand. â€œWith the opening of our 60th center as well as the implementation of state-of-the-art technology, we are looking forward to the growth opportunities that lie ahead.â€\\x9d\\nThe brand has targeted growth in Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Learn more about franchise opportunities at https://lightbridgeacademyfranchise.com/.\\nAbout Lightbridge AcademyÂ®\\n\\nEstablished in 1997, the company was founded as a family business based on core values and a Circle of Care philosophy that places equal importance on the needs of children, their families, teachers, center owners and the community. Lightbridge AcademyÂ® provides quality early education and child care programs to children aged six weeks through kindergarten. The company currently has over 120 child care centers either open or in development throughout Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.

Mitigating potential security risks before they even happen is key to both offerings.\\n\\n\\nTAMPA, Fla. (PRWEB)\\nAugust 31, 2021\\n Password Boss, an enterprise-class password manager solution provider for managed service providers (MSPs), announced today that it has acquired AutoElevate, a provider of automated privileged access management (PAM) software. The acquisition will bring together two best-in-class security solutions, giving MSPs the ability to better drive security for their own and their clientsâ€™ organizations. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\\nâ€œWhen our group took the reins of Password Boss in 2020, one of our goals was to expand our ability to better support MSP security in an ecosystem thatâ€™s increasingly under attack from cybercriminals and other bad actors,â€\\x9d said David Bellini, CEO of Password Boss. â€œAutoElevate is the perfect fit for two key reasons. One is that its endpoint privilege and automated PAM capabilities nicely complement our password management solution. Mitigating potential security risks before they even happen is key to both offerings. The second reason stems from the deep roots that both our team members have in the MSP community. We are all committed to expanding opportunities for MSPs and helping them realize their long-term business goals. I canâ€™t wait to see what we can do together.â€\\x9d\\nBellini and Todd Jones, co-founder of AutoElevate, have a combined 50+ years of MSP industry experience. In addition to his role as CEO of Password Boss, Bellini is a founder and CFO of ConnectOn, a Tampa Bay area provider of managed services, cloud services and security services. In 1982, he co-founded ConnectWise, a technology solutions provider for MSPs that was acquired by Thoma Bravo in 2019. The investor group that acquired Password Boss in 2020 includes Bellini, Drew McCallum and Adam Slutskin. Jones, who began his career in the managed services industry more than 20 years ago, founded a security-centric MSP practice in Colorado before it was acquired 2016. In 2018, he launched Miami-based AutoElevate to fulfill the need he saw for an MSP-based solution for privilege management. \\nBellini will serve as CEO of both organizations. Jones will remain with AutoElevate to manage operations and ongoing technology initiatives. \\nJones said that, like Bellini, he too is excited about what the two companies can do together in leveraging their unified mindset for an expanded MSP cybersecurity solution. â€œI saw early in my career that removing local administrative rights and employing endpoint privilege management immediately enhances an MSPâ€™s cybersecurity efforts and serves as one of the best ways to help stop malware and thwart attackers,â€\\x9d Jones said. â€œAt AutoElevate, we took that concept and then added a layer of automation that simplifies the management for MSPs. When any MSP takes advantage of the capabilities of our PAM software in combination with Password Bossâ€™ industry-leading password protection solution, that MSP is well on its way to building a strong perimeter defense against anyone who attempts to leverage it as a gateway to customer computers.â€\\x9d\\nPassword Boss, a complete end-to-end password management solution for MSPs, was designed and developed in 2014 specifically for the needs and the ways that todayâ€™s MSPs work and support their customersâ€™ password management needs. It provides a multi-tenant management portal that centralizes password management, automatic deployments through an MSPâ€™s remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, synchronization across devices, multiple layers of enterprise-grade security, dark web scans, and more.\\nAutoElevate adopts the principle of â€œleast privilegeâ€\\x9d for end user workstations for MSPs across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Administrative privileges are automatically elevated only when required to run approved and trusted applications. This limits the opportunity for an attacker to compromise an entire network by targeting privileged account passwords. Like Password Boss, AutoElevate leverages a multi-tenant central management portal and is easily deployed to allow MSPs to take control of use of privilege across their clients.  \\nBoth Password Boss and AutoElevate seamlessly integrate with a number of PSA, RMM and remote access tools, including those from Connectwise, Autotask and Kaseya. \\nA webinar focused on the recent Password Boss acquisition of AutoElevate and how it will increase the levels of cybersecurity protection for the MSP community is scheduled for Sept. 3 at 2 p.m. Eastern time.

The property is a high-performing Class-B 344-unit multifamily property in the metropolis of the strong performing Atlanta market. The property was bought in partnership with Blue Lake Capital, LLC, led by CEO Ellie Perlman. This powerhouse duo combined forces to successfully spearhead this acquisition via REV Fund - a joint-led $100M multifamily value-add fund established in May 2021.\\nThe property, located at 2620 N Berkeley Lake Road NW, Duluth, GA 30096, is a 2002 institutional-quality asset that enjoys an exceptional location and a promising interior renovation opportunity. In addition, the property also offers a robust amenity package including a resort-style swimming pool, large sundeck with a grilling area, fitness center, dog park, tennis courts, playgrounds, sprawling nature trails, and detached garages.\\nThe property will be enhanced via a value-add strategy, which entails installing modern apartment unit finishes such as stainless-steel appliances, vinyl plank flooring, new lighting and hardware, new backsplashes, and other features to further drive the desirable tenant base currently in place. Coupled with additional income-generating improvements, Vive Funds is confident in delivering a strongly performing and profitable asset to investors.\\nThis most recent acquisition marks further continued growth for Veena Jettiâ€™s portfolio and takes her portfolio to just over $500MM in AUM throughout the Texas, Florida, and Georgia markets.

By implementing expert hands-on strategies to lower costs and maximize collections, the company has recently pushed rents up by 23.65% on some units, well above proforma projections.\\nA defining factor in this strategy is founded in utilizing machine learning/artificial intelligence throughout the course of all acquisitions and asset management. This advanced technology enables the company to produce accurate and data-driven forecasting for all assets on a market, property, and even tenant basis. In doing so, Vive Funds is able to lead commercial investments with the full capabilities of todayâ€™s technology.\\nThe deal included several strong working partnerships, including the lending team, led by Melissa Marcolini Quinn, who is assisted by Lee Weaver, and Rob Rothaug, who all recently joined JLL. Large private funds and family offices are bullish on the sponsors and invested significantly into the deal. The SEC attorney, Nic McGrue of Polymath Legal, also played a crucial role in the deal structure.

We use the latest data from Australiaâ€™s Foreign Investment Review Board (â€œFIRBâ€\\x9d) to illuminate the change and its implications. \\nDuring the two years between June 2018 and July 2020, Australiaâ€™s Foreign Investment Review Board approved Singaporean investors to acquire AU$19.3 billion of Australian real estate, while Chinese entities received approval for just AU$13.2 billion of such investment. The gap in Singaporeâ€™s favour was AU$6.1 billion.\\nSingaporeâ€™s approved Australian real estate investment only first reached $5 billion in 2016-17. It quickly jumped to AU$8 billion the following year and then rose to more than AU$9 billion in the two most recent years, 2018-19 and 2019-20. Today, at 17%, it accounts for a larger share of the total than at any other time on record.\\nOn the contrary, Chinaâ€™s share of annual investment in Australian real estate ballooned between 2012 and 2018. Today, however, Chinese investment has fallen even as Singapore investment has climbed. China accounted for 26% of foreign real estate investment in Australia in 2015â€“16. Today, at 13% of the total, Chinaâ€™s share is still significant but below its recent peaks.\\nThe makeup of the two countriesâ€™ investment flows are different. \\nSingaporean investment is weighted towards large-scale investors purchasing commercial property and development sites. Chinese investment is now predominantly individual buyers purchasing residential units.\\nExamples of Singaporean investors include Singaporeâ€™s sovereign wealth fund GIC, Singapore Press Holdings, and listed Singaporean developers Wing Tai and Wee Hur â€” all of which acquired significant Australian assets in 2019-2020.\\nAcross all industries, and not just in real estate, Singapore is the third-largest source of proposed investment in Australia by value in 2019â€“20. It follows the United States and Japan and leads Canada and the United Kingdom. China is sixth.\\nOver the past decade or so, China is still by far the largest investor in aggregate. Chinese approved investments total about AU$126 billion since 2009-10. Thatâ€™s more than double the AU$56 billion invested by Singaporeans during the same time.\\n'},\n",

              "  'D': '\\n\\nNEW YORK (PRWEB)\\nAugust 24, 2021\\n Ramp, the first corporate card designed to help businesses spend less, today announced $300M in Series C venture funding at a $3.9B valuation. Founders Fund led the round, with participation from Redpoint Ventures, Thrive Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Spark Capital, Coatue Management, Iconiq, Altimeter, Stripe, Lux Capital, A* Partners, Definition Capital, Honeycomb, Kinetic, and other existing investors. Ramp has raised over $620M to date in a mix of equity and debt financing. \\nOver 2,000 US businesses are now using Ramp as their primary spend management solution leading to a tripling of transaction volume on Ramp corporate cards since the companyâ€™s $115 million Series B announced in April 2021, which valued the company at $1.6 billion. \\nRamp intends to use the new financing to accelerate development of its finance automation platform, designed to help businesses save time and money. On average customers save 3.3% annually by switching their corporate card spending to Ramp. Finance teams who use Ramp are able to account for and record all their business expenses at month end in just over 2 hours in most cases, representing a 90% reduction in time. \\nâ€œItâ€™s rare to find a company like Ramp whose growth is actually accelerating as they scale. Rampâ€™s vision of helping businesses spend less is clearly resonating with customers, so we are delighted to be leading this round,â€\\x9d said Keith Rabois, Partner, Founders Fund. â€œThe upside for Ramp is huge given the rapidly growing B2B payments opportunity and the ongoing consolidation of financial software in the enterprise.â€\\x9d\\nAlready the fastest growing US corporate card ever, Ramp has continued to grow rapidly this year with the number of cardholders on the platform increasing 5x since Jan 1. Growth has been driven by Rampâ€™s superior software and user experienceâ€”it has an industry-leading customer satisfaction score (CSAT) of over 95 and is rated Easiest to Use on G2.com in both expense management and spend management categories. \\nâ€œWe founded Ramp with the intent to empower businesses. Rampâ€™s mission is to save our customers time and money so they can focus on their mission,â€\\x9d said Eric Glyman, co-founder & CEO, Ramp. â€œFrankly the current state of finance tools and legacy card programs is not acceptable. They trap finance teams into doing unproductive â€˜busy workâ€™.  This funding will allow us to automate away even more of those tasks so that finance teams can focus on being more strategic.â€\\x9d \\nTo deliver that vision even faster, today Ramp is announcing the acquisition of Buyer. Buyer is the first negotiation-as-a-service platform that saves its clients an average of 27.3% on big ticket purchases such as annual software contracts. With the addition of the Buyer team, Ramp will be able to offer a customized and proactive approach to savings on large purchases, which goes beyond the generic perks and discounts that most corporate cards offer today. \\nIn the longer term Ramp also intends to expand its product offering as a result of the Buyer acquisition. By combining Buyerâ€™s team with benchmarking spend data from millions of transactions on its platform, Ramp wants to help its customers negotiate the best rate on anything that can be purchased with a cardâ€”from travel to softwareâ€”with the goal of shifting purchasing power back into the hands of buyers. \\nâ€œOver the course of the pandemic software spending ballooned. It is now the second largest line item for companies. By finding better value on these purchases, weâ€™ve been able to have a meaningful impact on the bottom line for many businesses,â€\\x9d said Kimia Hamidi, Founder and CEO of Buyer. â€œWe couldnâ€™t be more excited about joining the Ramp team, because both of our companies care deeply about helping our customers achieve more through savings. Joining Ramp will allow us to scale this vision.â€\\x9d \\nProving that business savings are a universal value proposition Ramp has attracted some of the fastest growing startups and unicorns like Ro, DoNotPay, Better, ClickUp, and Applied Intuition, in addition to established businesses across the US including Bristol Hospice, Walther Farms, Douglas Elliman, and Planned Parenthood. \\nAbout Ramp:\\n\\nRamp (http://www.ramp.com) is the worldâ€™s first finance automation platform. With Ramp, businesses get corporate cards and payments with built-in expense and accounting automation software â€” all in one free and simple solution. \\nUnlike legacy financial service providers, Ramp designs its products to help companies spend less. Customers save an average of 3.3% by switching their spending to the Ramp platform and are closing their books 5 days earlier each month. Founded in March 2019, Ramp is Americaâ€™s #1 rated and fastest-growing corporate card.\\n'},\n",

In addition, the strategic partner will assist FastWave Medical in accelerating global expansion by bringing its cutting-edge technology to China. \\nâ€œCurrent interventional approaches for atherosclerosis can be anatomically limited, procedurally complex, or result in complications such as dissection, perforation, or embolization.

              "  'C': 'The innovative early education and child care franchise brand celebrates the milestone with plans to double its size in the next five years.',\n",
              "  'D': \"\\n\\nISELIN, N.J. (PRWEB)\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n Itâ€™s been a busy 2021 for Lightbridge AcademyÂ®, one of the nationâ€™s leading providers of early education and child care. In addition to opening its 60th center in July, the rapidly expanding franchise brand is on track to open 22 new units in the next 15 months.  \\nCurrently, Lightbridge Academy has more than 120 centers open, under construction or in development in markets across the U.S. The franchise announced plans to expand its system from 60 to more than 150 centers by 2026. \\nA Year of Franchise Growth\\nThe brand opened six units this year, with new centers in NYC, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. By the end of 2021, Lightbridge Academy plans to have another six open. Three of the new units are owned by current franchisees who were looking to deepen their investment in the brand. \\nThe expansion comes despite the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic placed in front of the education sector last year. Lightbridge Academy more than maintained its growth momentum; its Holly Springs, North Carolina center opened in September with record-breaking enrollment numbers for the brand, followed by an Apex, North Carolina center that opened within six months of the Holly Springs location.\\nâ€œI am incredibly proud of what Lightbridge Academy has achieved over the course of this year and last,â€\\x9d said Gigi Schweikert, CEO. â€œFacing unprecedented challenges that directly impacted the way child care is delivered, our company was able to continue opening new centers and attracting new franchise partners.â€\\x9d\\nA New Investment Partner Spurs New Growth Goals\\nThe fuel for this accelerated growth plan is an infusion of capital from investment partners Westerly Group (Westerly) & Elmsley Capital (Elmsley). Unlike traditional private equity investors, who invest from funds with limited holding periods, Westerly & Elmsley invest on behalf of a small handful of families without a requirement to sell. \\nThis permanent capital makes them the ideal partners for Lightbridge Academy, whose core commitment to providing a high quality of care and early education in a safe and trusted environment has played a critical role in the lives of thousands of families for the past 24 years. This shift will combine Lightbridge Franchise Company with Jule Holdings, the owner of the corporately operated child care centers, under a new company â€“ Lightbridge Holdings Group.\\nAn Increasing Commitment To Operational Excellence\\nIn addition to growing its number of units, Lightbridge Academy has continued to invest in franchisee support. This year, it launched Lightbridge JourneyÂ®, a new center management software, that provides a 360-degree, centralized place for franchisees, providing increased operational efficiency, reduced operational costs and ultimately improved communication between staff and parents. \\nDuring the initial rollout of Lightbridge Journey, the platform proved its value: It saved 28 centers approximately 336 hours of time over 9 months, providing them almost an entire day per week to spend on relationship building with center families.\\nâ€œIt truly has been a year filled with incredible achievements for our brand,â€\\x9d said Joanne Sofia, chief operating officer of the brand. â€œWith the opening of our 60th center as well as the implementation of state-of-the-art technology, we are looking forward to the growth opportunities that lie ahead.â€\\x9d\\nThe brand has targeted growth in Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Learn more about franchise opportunities at https://lightbridgeacademyfranchise.com/.\\nAbout Lightbridge AcademyÂ®\\n\\nEstablished in 1997, the company was founded as a family business based on core values and a Circle of Care philosophy that places equal importance on the needs of children, their families, teachers, center owners and the community. Lightbridge AcademyÂ® provides quality early education and child care programs to children aged six weeks through kindergarten.
